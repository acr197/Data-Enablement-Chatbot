N2 JIRA Ticket Monthly Automation
Updated July 2025
Andrew Ryan





• Each month, activation teams must QA data populated in MCI from the previous month





BACKGROUND
• 
A new JIRA ticket is required for every brand and every channel to track their QA work


• Typically, Data Enablement's process was to manually clone, rename, and reassign 80+ tickets each month


• A new automation outlined in this deck can now batch-clone and rename all tickets, but some manual assignment is still required

Bookmark the Automation (One-Time Step)

* The automation is triggered from a bookmark in your primary browser.

- New Bookmark Name: Run JIRA Monthly Ticket Cloner
Skip to the Appendix for instructions on adding custom bookmarks if you are not sure how.


- New Bookmark URL: javascript:fetch('https://jira.publicismedia.com/rest/cb- automation/latest/hooks/10198a44128f8cdc6f2152e0007c7567c6414a75',{method:'POST',headers:{'Con tent-Type':'application/json'},body:'{}'}).then(()=>alert('Webhook sent!'));



3	Business Use Only

Run the Automation

* The automation should be run each month depending on what the Monthly Reporting Schedule requires.


* To run: Open any JIRA page, click the bookmark, and it will execute the automation to clone/rename all the tickets created in the previous month for the next month.


* Check that the tickets have been cloned successfully:
project = NA_US_PHM_Novartis_DEV AND summary ~ "Monthly Reporting Sign Off" ORDER BY created DESC










4	Business Use Only

Fine-tune the Tickets

* Assign the tickets using the Org Chart or using previous ticket assignees1:
- Use bulk edit to assign batches to the proper person per brand/channel
- Use bulk edit to change the due date if it's a mismatch
See the appendix on details how to bulk edit if you are not sure



* Check for missing tickets for new brand/channel launches:
- Any new brands launched recently, reach out to brand/channel teams to confirm that they need tickets and create them if needed
- Any new channels launched on existing brands, reach out to brand/channel team to confirm that they need tickets and create them if needed
Once new tickets are added, future automations will pick them up and clone as usual



* Refresh brand list for reporting
- Prior to cloning January Monthly Reporting Sign Off tickets (which happens in February), ask activation teams to confirm any new brand launches missing tickets and flag brands that have tickets but are no longer live.
- For any that are no longer live, do a full "Delete" of the ticket3

Tips for Smooth Monthly Ticket Creation

* Assignee: If team members reassign to another activation team member to complete, keep track of that for next month's build to ensure the Assignee is correct moving forward


* Bookmarks: It's a good idea to save the bookmark where you won't accidentally click it (e.g. store the link in its own bookmarks folder or only accessible from the bookmark manager).


* Launches: Teams may not always be proactive about informing us about new brand launches on their channels - do not hesitate to reach out to activation team members to confirm.


* Ideas: Send any other suggestions for improving this automation to the Data Enablement team!

Appendix

How it works: Part 1

Admins can access the Automation here.
The webhook is set as the trigger. JIRA creates a hook URL and when a HTTP POST is sent to it, it will run3.
The first step runs a JQL query searching for any ticket containing "Monthly Reporting Sign- Off" with a Created Date of the previous calendar Month in the Novartis_DEV project
Query:
project = NA_US_PHM_Novartis_DEV AND summary ~ "Monthly Reporting Sign Off"	AND created >= startOfMonth(-1) AND created < startOfMonth()




8	Business Use Only

How it works: Part 2

* The final rule clones all the tickets it finds in the JQL query.
- Summary: Clones the name except for the Month, where it searches for any month name and overwrites it with the following calendar month.

* Additional Fields: custom JSON is added to overwrite the new tickets fields with this:
- Start Date: Today's Date
- End Date: 8 business days after start date4
- Assignee: reset so this is Unassigned
- Checklist (customfield_#): carries over the checklist on the bottom right of each ticket
-	These are tied to a marketplace app named "Simple Tasklist", which is why these appear in JIRA as custom values.

Using Bulk Edit: Part 1

Step 1






* Step 1: Run a query for current-month tickets
- project = NA_US_PHM_Novartis_DEV AND summary ~ "Monthly Reporting Sign Off" AND created >= startOfMonth(-1) AND created < startOfMonth()
- Adjust as needed if selecting specific tickets (e.g. by Assignee, summary, date, etc)
- Select Tools > All Issues
* Step 2: Choose all issues if making a blanket change (usually for dates), or select specific tickets if only some tickets should be changed (usually for Assignee)
* Step 3: Click "Edit Issues"













Step 3










Step 2









10	Business Use Only

Using Bulk Edit: Part 2

* Find the field you need to edit. Typically, we would only need to edit Assignee or Due Date, which is near the top.


* Scroll to the bottom and decide whether all Assignees should be notified; uncheck "Send mail for this update" to avoid inbox clutter unless you want the Assignees / Watchers notified of the change.


* Click Next, review the ticket changes, click Confirm.

Creating Custom Bookmarks

* How to add bookmark based on Browser

- Chrome: Open Bookmarks Manager (Ctrl+Shift+O or chrome://bookmarks/), click the three dots top right, select "Add new bookmark"

- Edge: Go to Favorites Manager (Ctrl+Shift O or edge://favorites/) Click "Add Favorite" (star-plus icon). Right-click the new Favorite and click Edit

MONTHLY REPORTING - OVERVIEW
• 
Activation is responsible for QAing the N2 MCI Dashboard Data every month to ensure accurate reporting compared to individual UIs.
• The A&O (Analytics and Optimization Team) proceeds to review the dashboards and create individual brand insights based on delivery, benchmarks, AQ, etc.
• Data Enablement is responsible for ensuring dashboards populate the necessary data every month and perform QAs to help catch any overarching channel or data stream issues prior to each month's Activation Team QA Kickoff.





















Manual Reports and Checks
(Pre-Monthly Reporting Tasks)

MANUAL REPORTS AND UPLOADS


* The majority of our data to MCI is from API connections and batch file delivery from Pub Media Redshift or directly from MCI APIs. However, not all the data we receive is cut the way we need it for Novartis so we need additional manual and automated reporting.
These are the UI reports that we are responsible for:
* Uploaded to BOX, sent to Databricks, and delivered to MCI:
- Social Reach (META, Snapchat, and TIKTOK only)
* Set up in the UI and delivered daily to MCI for custom date ranges:
- Search Impression Share (SOV)
- Search Conversions
- Search DMA (User Location)
- Search Campaign Overview

This reporting must be uploaded/checked within the first two business days of each month for the prior month's dataset








9	Business Use Only

SOCIAL REACH UPLOADS




* Log into the dedicated platforms and set up a report that you will manually generate each month.
- We cannot set up automated reporting as the UIs do not auto include new accounts
- You will need to ensure all new accounts are selected and added to the report each month
* If you are creating a report for the first time, you can recreate the reports based on the previous reports saved in the BOX folder
- You will need a Year to Date (YTD) and Monthly Report set up in each applicable UI




10









*we can only get social reach data from META, Snapchat, Tiktok

SOCIAL REACH UPLOAD CHECK



* Social Reach data should populate within N2 MCI two days after the reports are uploaded to Box.
* Please check that there is social campaign reach data populating for the last full month (reporting cycle month) within N2 MCI.
- You do not have to QA against the platform UI report. This should be done by the social brand teams in their monthly QA while they also QA Social Funnel and Social Objective classifications and metrics





11

SEARCH AUTOMATED REPORTING


* Search has two individual business accounts (Legacy Oncology and Legacy Pharma)










* Within each account there are 5 automated reports set up (10 total)






















12

SEARCH AUTOMATED REPORTING CHECK
* We need to make sure these reports continue to run daily into N2 MCI
* At the beginning of the month make sure we have conversions and Branded IS (SOV) for the current reporting cycle (last month) in N2 MCI
- We do not have to QA against the UI for these fields as Search should be QAing to ensure the data is classified correctly and align with campaign expectations


*You will not see Branded IS for Bing and you will not see anything for Search IS after their Auction Insights Update in 2024

National to DMA Monthly Comparison
(Pre-Monthly Reporting Tasks)

DMA TO NATIONAL DATA - SNOWFLAKE TO UI COMPARISON



At the beginning of every month, our PGD team assists us by running delivery QA between UI and Snowflake for the previous month. This consists of checking the following platforms:
* Campaign Manager
* SA360
* All Social Platforms
* Programmatic (Spend Only) And the following metrics:
* Impressions
* Clicks
* Spend (For Search, Social, DSPs)


Impression, Click, Spend Discrepancies should be < 3% between Snowflake and UI


This reporting must be uploaded/checked within the first three business days of each month for the prior month's dataset

DMA TO NATIONAL DATA - SNOWFLAKE TO UI COMPARISON



All team members should have access to pull National and DMA impression and click delivery.

Step 1: Generate UI Reports from each Platform and Upload to Box
* You can follow reporting examples that have been previously uploaded to Box to help you create your own version of the UI report: https://lion.app.box.com/folder/284569047972
Step 2: Run queries on the designated National and DMA delivery Snowflake tables
* Instructions on how to run and the queries to use can be located on the Box note file: https://lion.app.box.com/notes/1646137631394
Step 3: Compare and Compile
* XLOOKUP for Campaign IDs and Placement ID/Ad Group ID to compare both datasets and compile insights for any discrepancies higher than 3% or for any missing data

DMA CODE CHECKS




When the monthly DMA reports are pulled out of Snowflake for the prior QA, please pivot to see how many DMA codes are coming up as NULL.


If we have NULL showing in the Snowflake data, please add to the DMA_REF_MASTER file with the code 000 so that it doesn't cause an issue in Novartis data.

Alerts and Ticketing

MONTHLY REPORTING KICKOFF

* Once the pre-monthly reporting tasks have been complete you will notify the team if there's any identified issues preventing a channel activation team from being able to complete upcoming QAs
* This notification will occur in the Teams channel: N2 Full Team - DG/AO | General | Microsoft Teams

















MONTHLY REPORTING KICKOFF

* A&O will send out a notification to all channel teams letting them know Monthly Reporting has begun so that they can start their JIRA process
* As the channel team QA they will inform our team of any issues via our Monthly Reporting Issues Smartsheet Tracker
* Please refer to the appendix for the JIRA and Smartsheet ticketing processes



 Tracked in Smartsheets

MONTHLY REPORTING - FRIDAY NOTIFICATIONS

* On Fridays, a notification must be sent to Activation and A&O aggregating any outstanding issues we are aware of from an overall channel level down to a ticket level issue.


* Green dot - no impact
* Yellow dot - some channel impact
* Red dot - full channel impact


* Below that please list out individual ticket/brand/channel issues






















Ongoing Maintenance

NVS AND MCI DAILY DATA STREAM CHECKS
* We need to ensure none of our ENABLED Daily Data Streams are failing within our N2 and NVS Datorama. This check occurs daily.


NVS MCI
You will need to check for the following
- Data Streams that start with N2

These Data Streams should show
- Run Status as Successful
- Last Run Date should be within the past two days
- The toggle should be blue for Enabled Stream
- Execution History should show the last ran reports were successful

* If a Data Stream has failed, or does not look like it's running properly, please open a troubleshooting subtask ticket within the Ongoing JIRA Story and assign to your Manager.

NVS AND MCI DAILY DATA STREAM CHECKS
* We need to ensure none of our ENABLED Daily Data Streams are failing within our N2 and NVS Datorama. This check occurs daily.
N2 MCI

You will need to check for the following
- Data Streams that start with SEM - SA360
- Data Streams that start with NVS FEED
- Data Streams that say LinkedIn

These Data Streams should show
- Run Status as Successful
- Last Run Date should be within the past two days
- The toggle should be blue for Enabled Stream
- Execution History should show the last ran reports were successful

* If a Data Stream has failed, or does not look like it's running properly, please open a troubleshooting subtask ticket within the Ongoing JIRA Story and assign to your Manager.

SOCIAL LIVE TRACKER

Tracked in Email

Pub Media Ticketing


* The Social Live Tracker is an email that gets sent to the Social Activation Team on a daily basis to notify them of the following:
- 1st Section: Campaigns they have created in Placement Manager that have prior to present start dates in the current year that we are not receiving data for
- If a campaign shows here, we need to request a backfill from Pub Media to start receiving data for this campaign
- 2nd Section: Campaigns that are missing start dates in Placement Manager where we cannot verify if we should be receiving data or not
- If a campaign shows here, the social team needs to update Placement Manager accordingly


Classification Updates and Weekly Classification QA

* We QA our Data Classifications on a Weekly Basis to track and rectify potential errors and issues as soon as possible
- Novartis is constantly looking at the data which is why we need to have frequent checks of what is occurring with our Classifications and to assess if updates are needed
* Times we will update our classifications:
- We've identified an issue within our Weekly QA Process
- Novartis tickets us with an issue that is directly tied to classifications
- Our internal Activation Teams ticket us with an issue that is directly tied to classifications
- We are launching a new brand and indication
* Classifications are Created and Managed within the NVS MCI Connect and Mix
- They are manually made, SQL based classifications in the calculated dimensions field and are divided out into two categories
- DEV: where we make any initial classification changes and QA
- PROD: where we update the classification once it's approved to go live




WEEKLY CLASSIFICATION QA


Data Enablement performs Weekly Classification QA to catch any erroneous mappings or unclassified fields

Weekly IPMM/Control Confirmations

* We check Control Files weekly to track expected and unexpected changes. This helps us to notify Novartis of any changes and also keep track of expected changes for upcoming IPMM cycles on the client side.
* Our PGD Managers compile the changes week over week and submit it to us within a JIRA ticket. Within the document we confirm if changes are to be expected, or need to be investigated.
* Anything that is anticipated to have impact to future IPMM cycle needs to be documented within the tracking Smartsheet at an overview level.

4. If Snowflake matches UI then check NVS MCI. Does NVS MCI match UI? Are NVS data streams running and does the data stream have a date cap/lookback in the query (if so - reach out to Manager)? Check Classifications again. Check DEV, LIVE, and RI dimensions against the metrics. Are exports running from NVS to N2 MCI? Are N2 data streams running? Is there an issue with the dashboard widget filters in N2 MCI?
5. If Snowflake doesn't match UI check Redshift
6. If Redshift matches UI then issue in Snowflake. Export Redshift data. Open JIRA ticket with Engineering and provide all exports and Redshift tables you checked.
7. If Redshift doesn't match UI export data. Open ticket with Pub Media and provide all exports and details.
Missing or discrepant Impressions and Clicks

Redshift (DCM)
Digital1. Check PLD Snowflake Table. Do we have the PLD for the package in the activity table? Check for any column discrepancies. Check DM_ID/Media Buy Key
2. If PLD is missing from the Snowflake activity table, check the NPI Live Tracker Snowflake table. Has NPI data been shared to Novartis for the package? Check note column - is PLD even expected? Check for any column discrepancies. Check DM_IDs/Media Buy Key
3. If PLD is expected in Live Tracker, but is not in the PLD activity table reach out to Theresa Patti, Roger Matias, and Chaitanya Bhardwaj and CC Thomas Hughes and Chris Frazier. Hold up could be on Novartis side for processing and delivery to Snowflake tables.
4. If PLD is not expected inform team member who flagged it was missing
5. If PLD is not missing from the activity table check NVS MCI. Are classifications causing an issue? Are NVS data streams running and does the stream havea date cap/lookback in the data stream query (if so - reach out to Manager)? Are NVS MCI exports running to N2 MCI? Are N2 data streams running? Are dashboard widgets and filters set up correctly?

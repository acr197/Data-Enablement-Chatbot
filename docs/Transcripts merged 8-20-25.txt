OK.cool 
5o this is our end to j 1rama. 
5o thi5 is our ageoc;y side data Rama. 
You will be able to tell the difference between the 
Novartis data Rama and our data Rama by the 
following. 
X 
We have this like this. like weird like generalized 
icon with Novartis underneath it in the left side 
and then poo bulls. This health media on t he nght 
side for the internal 
Novartis. 
That like N2 data Rama. the agency side dat a 
Rama. 
For t he client side data Rama I have one open 
t hought I did 
I know I logged in 
Zero. OK. 
Sorry I have like so many browsers open right now. 
OK 
This one Is a Novartis side data Rama. 
It looks almost ident ical except for the fact that 
t heir icon in t he le~ side is the big no artist's 
words. and it on the right side Is a Salesforce. 
That Is how you're gonna tell the difference 
between the two Is I also. 
Opeo them in different browsers too, because I 
find 1t 
It's a lit1Ie easier for me to navigate. 
And make sure I'm not making updates or 
checking things in the wrong one if I haven't be-en 
separate browsers 
5o I typically keep t he Novartis one in my like 
Chrome and I keep like the N21 and like edge. 
But whatever makes it easier. they look like 
identical when you're i n them. 
i 
And,~ Ryaon 
h42 
OK 
() :7~ '::~ a~:nc;y side one we'll we'll talk about 
t his one first. so. 
Basically, there's we have a couple tabs at lhe top 
t hat you·11 have access to. 
To visualize. which Is the actual dashboard views 
analyze and act. which Is where we typically pull 
reports or like have like automated reports 
generating 
Also. where you could create a pivot table, so if 
you're if you need a look up like data quickly 
without like using a dashboard 
That Is where I typically or where we typically do a 
lot of our quic~ analyzation, because you could 
just 
Add in rows or streams or columns and 
dimensions like. 
Really quickly. And t hen there's connected mix and 
connecting connected mix. 
For t he N2 datorama fully Just houses some of our 
data streams and some of our connections and 
metrics that we're get1ing. 
5o I'm gonna focus right now just on. 
The database portion of It 
5o what we have. how we have this set up is I'm 
gonna collapse that really quick. 
We have a few different 
Views like like like kind of like shelves for 
dashboards so. 
End to mont hly report is where all of our 
dashboards are t hat are activation teams. 
Our QA in a month. 
Then there·s a classification. 
Dashboard that we use. So like if people are telling 
us that there·s issues wrth the data coming 
through on their dashboards, rll typically use the 
dashboards in the N2 classification QA to confirm 
up some stuff on whether I think it's like an issue 
of us getting data. 
Into datarama, Or if I think it's like it's being 
classified incorrectly. 
lqva II 
I don't currently use, but we will be using. 
Saying t hese are 
Excuse me, I am like suffering with my altergres 
today. 
lqva Is basically alt the data that we are getting 
from iqva. 
5o we use iqvia as a measurement partner on 
Novartis versus like acnx:ess or comScore. 
5o this is all the data t hat we're ingesting from 
them 
And t hen the only ot her one that we use is 
typically the work in progress 
5o this is where if Kyle is or hke one of us is 
creating a ne,..., dashboard 
Will create it first in t he work of progress and t hen 
when we push, publish it or push 11 live will create 
like its own collection. 
Under under this section. 
CJ 
I::: 


So for the monthly reports. we have quite a few. 
So I'm going lo skip these two for now, but we are 
t eam, so each team has access to these 
dashboards or review of these dashboards. 
They they get like a published link. so they can just 
access it through the link without having to like log 
And t his is how t heir QA. QA ING every month 
So they're they're told to come in and they're most 
of these are kind of split out the same way with 
t heir own. 
Reporting dimensions so for display. 
The the display team. 
So programmatic and direct emerging will come in 
here. 
They"ll look up the brand name. 
AME that they're looking for, whether it's branded 
or unbranded and whether it's OTC o r HGP. And 
t hen select the month that they're supposed to be 
QA ING 
So they they just got done. 
QA in March. 
And all they're supposed to do is Just come m here 
and tell us if the numbers look right. So they're 
told to come in. 
They"re like, you !::now, we're hke, hey, are we 
pulling. like, do you see everything pulling in? 
Like. are we getting cost metrics? 
Are we getting impressions? 
Are we getting dicks? Afe we getting Ctr. Are we 
getting? 
Ability and then there t hey come down here to 
see. We split out the partners by whether they're 
an endemic partner or just like our readl partner. 
Or if 1hey're endemic. social 
We have partners classified this way and typically 
to be honest with you, I still don't know which 
partners classify as what like I know. 
You know for programmatic? 
They"re always a reach partner versus like an 
endemic partner. 
But typically, if we if it's being classified incorrectly, 
they let us know and we say, well, what is this 
partner? 
And they let us know. 
And then we just reclassify. Jackie knows a little is a 
little bit more like off to the feed on what is what. 
But I I sllll don't necessarily understaOO what 
makes. 
I don't necessarily understand when we can notify. 
Figure out when a partner is considered a social 
endemic partner versus an endemic partner. 
But like our social stuff is m a different dashboard. 
So this 1s like social bought through their partners. 
so it does get confusing, but if you're not sure. you 
can always ask us or you can Just have the direct 
t eam or the programmatic team clarify what 
they"re supposed to be considered. and theo 
they'll check the cost. 
They"ll check the cost and then they'll check lil::e 
t he what 1s happening here? 
That's weird. 
I d on't know why those were pulling in when 
they're selected 
But basically they'll checl:: like OK. Does the 
oppressions look correct? 
So if they if the direct team launched something 
with health health line, their responsibility is to go 
to let us know if this does not match Prisma. And if 
this does not match DCM. if it does not they !et us 
know. 
And like match is loose. 
There is a discrepancy threshold. So like we say. if 
it's anything greater than 3% to let us know. 
With Prisma. Prisma is like constantly in flux. 
So that is guaranteed to be like within that 3% 
range. The t he amounts is always is always 
changing if they're actualizing and changing that 
figure. we tell them to wait two days before 
checking the dashboard again. 
Because it takes a while for the figure to update. 
So they're supposed to check all this and let us 
know if something is wrong 
Typically for display, r m gonna let you know right 
now for display. 
The the API connections for display are usually on 
point. 
There's usually like no. Like, there's usually no real 
issues with display. If there is. it's rare or it's like a 
So a lot of t he times if I see a question coming 
through with display, ru typically take it because I 
just think that they're looking at the data wrong. 
But this typically display is like, There·s usually no 
issues here. 
For programmatic. it's the same. They're supposed 
to be checking if the cost matches. 
Now for programmatic, we don't pull spend from 
Prisma, right? 
Like Prism a for programmatic is just a shell. 
Ofa budget. 
But is it factual to the like bidding numbers in the 
DSP and the cost that should be generated from 
t he DSP? 
So that cost is coming from the from the DSP 
platform itself. 
So programmatic is supposed to come in here and 
say, hey. does this cost is t his cost in line with 
what's in t he DSP. is t his impression number 
accurate? 
And again t his impression number is coming from 
DCM. 
DCM is our source of t ruth. 
So they•re supposed to be coming in here and 
checking that and then t here's a bunch of creative 


metrics at the bottom that are year to date. 
We don't get a lot of questions on this. 
I think this is just a nice to have. 
So again. they're more they should be checki ng 
t his at the partner level and letting us know 1f 
t here's any issues. 
You'll see this benchm.irk section at the top. 
And some brands have 
Specific benchmarks tied to it. 
Oh. 
OK.well. 
That's not working right ? 
There we go. 
I think 'cause it's probably for the whole year. 
That's weird t hough. 
So there they have benchmark .it the top for 
different brands and it's being pulled in here 
Some of them have the center have actr and a 
viewability number. It all depends on the brand. 
Most of the brands should have standardii ed 
benchmarks. 
We like enforce that this year. saying like we. 
You can't like like balance what you need and 
these l ike executive summary tabs. which I'll go 
If your benchmarks are all different like if Cosentyx 
is like saying the benchmarks or like if kisqali is 
saying the benchmarks are one thing. but then 
Entresto they're different. 
It makes it hard to g ive them what they need, so 
they standardize the benchmarks for this year 
except for Cosentyx. 
Cosentyx is. you'll find out. 
Of the Cosentyx is the special child on Novartis, 
So they kind of get whatever they want. 
So yeah. so this is what the display team is QA ING 
against if every month and letting us know if 
there's any issues. 
So that's the ticketing t hat I'm showing you 
yesterday like we ticket them and JIRA. we say hey, 
go in QA your dashboard it's writing. 
l et us know if there's any issues and then if there is 
issues. they send us a smartsheet t icket about it 
and then we investigate it. 
And fix it for them. 
Or let them know if it's like not an issue. 
And t hen we close out the ticket and then they can 
proceed and let the analytics team know like, OK. 
our dashboard is good. 
You're you're good to compile your insights and 
send 11 to the client. 
Each dashboard IS krnd of s1m1lar. 
They just have their own kind of look and feel to it. 
So. 
I still haven't updated this. 
OK.cool. 
The video is similar, so they're looking for the same 
exact things. It split. Our video is split by different 
types of video partners versus like. 
A like endemic versus social for video. 
It's like is this an online video partner? 
Is this an over the top partner? 
Is this an addressable TV partner? 
Is it a demo social partner? 
So they have t heir own method of like splitting out 
the delivery. 
So again. the video team like I get like I said 
before. video is a little weird on our on our 
account. We have three different teams activating 
video. 
We have the direct team activating online video 
and ctctv. 
We have programmatic activating online video and 
CTV. and then we have the video investment team 
activatmg CTV addressable TV linear TV. 
All that happy like offline t raditio nal stuff. 
So each team is coming in and checking their 
partner. 
Like what they've activated oo? 
Bad: in the cost. 
This is so crazy that this is doing this, 
I gotta talk to Kyte about this. 
They're checking the impressions. 
They're saying, hey. do these impressions match? 
DCM. do these impressions match? 
Does the cost match Prisma? 
And again. this is gonna change. 
I'll go over t his with you, but depending on the 
The type of channel. t he cos1 source changes. so if 
it's direct team activating video is coming from 
Prisma. 
If it's programmatic. it's coming from the DSP. 
If it's video investment. it's coming from a 
combination depending on if it's traditional TV 
versus hke CTV. 
If it's CTV is coming from Prisma 
If it's traditional TV is coming from these hke it's 
coming from media tools. ifs coming from these 
independent TV tables that they're that we're 
keeping with them, so. 
They're responsible for coming in here and making 
sure that those costs and those impressions align 
and everything is listed out the way that it's 
supposed to be like. 
A perfect example is last month our team, our 
programmatic team, let us know that they were 
not seeing. 
Miss Pmx spy that they had and we realized that it 
was being grouped under a different partner. 
So we had to go in and red ass1fy 11 to split it out so 
t hat this pmx by had its own partner name and 
wasn't just grouped under Tradesk CTV swoop. 


So we went m and broke It out so they could see. 
The metrics independently because they asked for 
So this is thlS IS what video IS. 
Queuing aud10 looks pretty much the same. similar 
to video. 
Where they JUSt hke. have stmtlar lond of. 
Lilcesimil.irsetup. 
WithJUSl 
The partner metncs. 
Actually, no. rt does not match video at all 
So ignore me. 
We don't have much audio, so you don't have to 
worry about that. 
We have very little aud10 on Novartis nght now. 
But they'll let us know 1f that's wrong e-mail. 
E-mail 1s finicky. Just as a heads up there. 
Sometimes 11"s classified a little weird so let me 
see if I can pull up a different. 
You"II find that e-mail Is a httle bit of the bait of our 
existence on this account. 
And like the reason being 1s Just l1k.e. 
They care so much about thetr e-mail metrics 
because they do so much. 
Hep e-mad marketing. but hk.e sometimes. 
Our ,KlsvatJOn team IS don•t split out the emails 
like at the pack.age level or hk.e they they roll them 
up at the pack.age level so. 
So sometimes thee-ma~ 1s bemg classified as 
display. 
Vers.use-ma1l 
Sometimes. 
They're expectmg hk.e HCP metna f0< this versus 
just impressions.so. 
It rt you'll nollce as time~ on that we talk. 
about e-mail a lot and it's JU St beaivse it's such a 
weird channel that they buy. 
And sometimes ifs like they're buying e-mail 
independently, but sometimes the e-mail Is hk.e an 
add on to the display by or sometimes it's a 
conference. so you'll notice that we tallc about 11 a 
lot. 
But for this part. I think. the most common 
questions we get here is that. 
They don't see the partner listed on their e-mail 
and l'lt 90 into the dass1ficat1on tabi. and find out 
that it is being classified as display. 
Or if other like a separate partner name or 
something like that so. 
Yeah. So th,s is JUSt the e-mail IS pretty basic. I 
think we're gonna be adding. 
And for some of these. 
We're talltrng about adding m some of that HCP 
metrics. 
So that's to come. But r,ght now we're JUSt pulling 
m Impressions. 
O.d you do a lot of e-mail on the KCOUnts that 
you've preVIOUSly been on by any chance? 
-. Andre....Ry.,, 19:11 
AH we did was grve QA the tags. 
It's ltrnda wt.ere 1t began and ended. 
u
:t~IPiot 19:15 
OK. Did you, did you guys have, did your teams 
tag it where and this 1s a fight that I've been 
having at the agency for hk.e 5 years. 
Did you guys tag it? 
Where if you did you tag a custom e-mail and a 
banner e-mail. 
The same exact waywtiere hk.e we're always 
tracking the d1elcs. but regardless If it's a banner. e-
mail or custom e-maIL we·re sending them an 
impression tracker to treat ~ke an open. 
To like track opens versus the banner . 
._ 
Andfe....RyM 
19:SO 
I we must have some mind fora ·cause. I med to 
make that a process 'cause. h's 1ncon51stent aaoss 
accounts like I always thought that there should be 
a separate tag Just for 1mpreSS1ons and the rest JUSI 
dodidts.

So good MWS IS that now With Jacbe- lernng tKIM 
~t 
like this II something that I feh rnlly 
strongly wrth on Novarta and I broU 11 down to 
them like 100 tunes. 
And we do try to tag that way on Novartis. 
So they are supposed to be communiut1ng. 
It doesn't always happen. but -
are suppoffd to 
be tagging on Novartis where? 
Regardless of the e-mail type, 1f !l's an e-mail 
,,. 
They should be sendm9 the part nu an 1mpreu10n 
tag solely to track: the open109 of the open of the

-.,,, 
It's !l's like a f'IICt to have •• thlS p01nl but the HCP 
level data rs what matters and thats the offhne 
The reason why I've tried to enf0fC4t them to tag 11 
wrth the the open is because l'vt! told the team 
that I don't trust the partners and I think that 
they're inflating the HCP numbers that they send 
back and these buys are expensive, right? 
.. Andrew Ryan 22:A!i 
0~ 
() :::.~::to fflH• wre !hat they're not n 
They're not inflating thow numbers. 
So the the lfflprftMOfl open lfflprtiMOn tag IS.

If the run hen are coming bid: Of .. :e wonky. and

But so there are HCP numbers lhould always be

Because our impression tag 1s grabbing ewrythmg 
and can't weed out non HTP 1mpress1on1. 
So 1f they're sending back HTP numbers, the nurse 
saying. well, we reached 2000 unique Heps. but our 
impression tag only has 800 1mpreu10ns. How 11 
that poSSlble?

maybe this is an overs1mphfteat1on. but that QA 
tool that everybody has to do before the data QA 
that Michael Cle. 
Owns. That automatts IL 
What rf tn«e was something on thffe that

Oh. I thought I WH onto somethmg. AH nghL

That's the kind that's hke, perfect. 
That's the kind of stuff that we have to figure out 
because like nght now. like on ours, It took me 
through ,t. 
It took me literally, l think 2 years w,th the 
combtMd team to be hke you absolutely ~

So tt--5 rs. I mcl that sooal and March IS pro~bfy 
gonN1 lib the most to bnd of 9et famdiar W1lh. 
With then II thff ~d1 •• stll by repon 
But then thew stuff is bfoteo out by bkt Nch 
pMtnef, and tMfl they haYt .. e I obJKtive hke I I 
full,1~ob,ect,w.AlotofthttirMSwe9ft.we 
do get I lot ol. we ge1 1 lot of tickets for sooaL we 
get a lot. 
Of tld::ets for search becauM theft u a lot of 
manual 
lngestJOn that's occurnng for th~r platforms.. And 
then there's also. 
So a lot of hke overndes that ~
·rt doing to like, 
categorize stuff. 
So mostly. what search will either gtt? 
The. 
For the campa1gf\ a campaign ,s m1u1ng. which. ,f 
that's the case, 1s typ,calty hk• 11 Offds to be 
backfilled. 
So that's when M reach out to pub mtd1a or 
they'rt! hkl' RE12. Firl' IS hh reflKting somtehing 
likl' not nght. And thly'I bf kk-. can you ~If 
11 
,001 
And they tel us what thfy nNd upcbttd IS thfyll 
...... 
Can you update It to bf 1,1:t educ.atior\ traffic. 
dash. thisorWNtfYl'f and we'l,nt hk.t manually 
update rt. 
Thats typiolly IN what we gl't from lfWm. All of 
then cost corMS from thf M30al platforms 
themselves and ill of the ,mprtis,ons ~ 
from 
the sooal platfom-.s as w.iL 
If !hue. 1f thert!'s cost. that"s off. What ,f they rt 
hke. hey, the cost ,sn·t matching what I typiully do 
,s or what Kyte and I do is.. 
We'll they'll send screenshots, but 1drl'w c.n I hke 
tell you how many limes I had to h111e like whit a 
good screenshot and I bad scrHnshot is on 1h11 
account. 
It's it's crazy. 
Like sometimes they'll send mt 11kt this this box. 
And I"m hke. what do you want mt to do with that? 
So sometunl'S and somet,mn they don't even 
send screenshots from the UI 
So like instead of wasting tlmt 50met,mn rN JUSI 
go in and pul it myself. 
Or lfrm having a bad clay. rl}Ust t~ tht-m like you 
need to Mod me a saNNhot of the UL buL 
l'I typally 90 W'I loot at thf l.N to Sff what we. ff 
set!lfl9 ., the UL and then rl t»cttt,Klt. 
So likt! from the dashboard lilce think of INS 
~d 
as the final toudlpow,t that this and 
two d~rd IS the final 
for al of thl' channels. 
So rf 50mt!thmg's wrong her-, we nHd to 
badctrack. 
We net'd to find out. 
Where?Where 1t'swrong? 
If 11 is 11 wrong from tht? 
Is it wrong from pickup hke our first touch point or 
is 11 stuck somewhere along the way? 


So whal 1'11 typically do is I WIii. 
look up 1f the cost is off or the 1mpress10ns are off. 
But we have some form of Impress.ons or cost. I'~ 
gototheUI. 
1'11 took at the time frame. 
llf get the ru get the report of the full cost or the 
full 1mpreSS10ns out of the OR like anything .ise. 
like reach or whatever out of the system and ru 
download 11 and then I'll 90 to. 
ttypicallywillgobackto.1. 
So our .1 fOf sooal would be pub media. 
So I look at our redshift data 1st and I query and I 
loo< 
Again. we'll go through this m much rn depth at a 
later point. but we'll query the data m redshift. 
I'll see 1f that data matches. If that data doesn"t 
match m redshift. that means there's something 
wrong with the data mtake from the API, or like 
batch file loads or whatever pub media 1s doing. 
So that is the case that I'll open the ticket and I'll 
send them Au1 report and I'll be like. 
Breadsh1ft doe,sn't match our UI. 
Please fl)[ that like t'II give them like the date range. 
•• Andr- Ry•n 3':10 
Mm hmm. 
() 1~ 
~~1~: the campaign name. the account 
10, stuff like that 
And then. but ,f rt does match In redshift. that 
me.ms there's something going on on our side 
that 1s like ifs stud:: somewhere or someth1ng's not 
going right 
So from there 1"11 typically query snowflalce because 
it it for social all of our soaa! stuff. for the most 
part goes from pub Media API to they go into 
redshift. 
We ingest redshift into snowflake. 
We ingest the snowflake data mto the Novartis 
data Rama and then 11 does this hke weird process 
where loop the loops back into Snowflake goes 
back into Novartis MCI and then comes mto here. 
This Is the final touchpo1nt so I'll typically 1f it's not 
wrong m redshift and redshift m UI are matching 
ther1 I then I'll go to Snowflake. 
If snowflake's matching, tht'fl l'N go to Novanis 
MCI. 
And and so so on and so forth until I find the point 
in wh!Ch 11 doesn't 
It does not match. 
And then there's different w.rys that we update n. 
So that's like something that well land of talk 
about as we go because hke that's like that"s land 
of hke the Wt'lrd nuance. the unique SJtuallon 
where maybe not ewry. 
Srtuat1on of resolution is identical and will rely on 
like each ch.mn.i or each hke Of each like. 
Ocusmn that It's off. but yeah. so each ooe land of 
follows ,ts rts own structure. but that's how I we 
typ1c.ally get questJons about Iha! and that's 
typ1c.ally how I have to we have to resolve sooal.

If REACH is off with sociaL so I don't know whal's 
happening with reach metnc. There we 90. If 
REACH is off. 
I wdl typtcaUy check. 
To see if. 
I wdl check the UI and then l'tl have to check reach 
we get We do pull ourseNfl. We do monthly 
upklads the box and then we pull that number into 
Snowflake. 
And into the Rama versus going through the the 
pub Medi~ API ·cause. we can't get that land of 
data there. 
11 reaches off typicaly have to chedt the UI and 
then have to ched: the repottS that we uP't)ad. 
Somet1me,s we have to hke repull maybe hke 
REACH changed abruptly hke on the Sth of lhe 
month after we already pulled the report. 
So we might have to JUSI hke re upload 1t. 
Or sometimes maybe the reaches like being 
ctass1fied under a different mdicat10n. Then for 
some reason then where everything else Is and we 
just have to hke rectass1fy. 
Cool. I'm gonna skip lqV1a prmt out ·cause. I won't

I'm still get kmd of getting where's lqv data.

automatJGatly gener.1111. So for search. 
Currently we get national it-v.l ,mprH5IOAI.

Impressions. click and cost through pub m~1a. but 
we get OMA level data 
Depression costs and chcks we get

From an autom1tt'd reportmg, we get OMA. 
From an automalt'd reportmg, we get co~rst00s 
from an automated repe>ftm9. 
Yeah. What elw we we get from them. but we're 
pultng a lot of stuff m~lly from that UI beause 
we JU5t c.an·t get lhoH arts of dita from pub

We're still wo,king through thH• bas1c1lly. 
Our analytics team used to hi ve, !Ike a summary of

But yeah. that's the monthly dashbolrd5. This IS all 
the stuff that like the actrvatIon tHms are looking

And this IS k,nd of all the stuff you'll be

When you start getting hke ticketing hke we·u loop 
you into the llcket1ng process. we'll 90 through

U =::::~art r1~ly helpful 
So we set these up fof us to lff lllc1. 
Because these are so generalized and 11 partner

being classified incorrectly? 
So what they're supposed to do tf they don't see 
somethmg they're supposed to 9Ive us? l ike what?

•· 
We have kinda open the eight-year ticket Just to 
keep track. 
So I Just show my screen. 
Yeah. So right now we·re doing April. 
So every month you j ust kind of cloned us and 
assign it to yourself. And right here are all t he 
instructions for you to pul!. 
So the three main platforms that we want to pull 
reach for is Facebook. Snapchat and Tilctok. 
The reason why we're doing this is because pub 
media. 
X 
For whatever reason, their API can't pull reach data 
property. 
We can pull other stuff such as impressions, clicks 
and spend before reach. 
We lleed to do this manual process. 
So that's our Facebook 'cause Facebook is usually 
the biggest one and we usually run the most 
campaigns on that. 
So this is Facebook. 
As you can see. we j ust we have a lot of reports in 
here. So the only thing that you need to look for is 
reach. 
Let's see. 
Wait a minute. 
There we go. 
I believe you can just go in ads reporting and 
doesn't matter what accounts you·re on, it should 
have au the reports that we have for all accounts. 
So what you need to do is to go to the reach first 
of all the reach multiple accounts a month. 
Everything should remain the same. There is date 
range we set up as last month. but you know j ust 
So l"s tinkering with the report and t he date range 
change. 
Make sure that is pointing at last month, especially 
for the reach. 
Monthly. 
Reach multiple Accounts Month report 
You go i n and first of all you select all the accounts 
t hat we have. 
So madhulika, as I said before. you ship access to 
at least 198 add a.ccounts and not 21. 
So just double check with that 
Press apply. 
Then you Just export this and rn include a 
summary row and export. 
While we wait for. 
That awesome. 
Now you save, go back out and we do the same 
thing for the year to date one. 
So we have so in the dashboard we have a 
monthly view and a usdate view and with REACH 
data specifically. 1t needs to be deduplicate. 
So that's why we can't really do like a for you 
today, you know, like addmg up the recent 
numbers for every month. 
But we have to pull. 
That you need that out so this at t he year to date 
level? 
You can see we need to put this to April. 
Update t his. 
All accounts apply. 
And then we export this out. 
It may take a while. 
So every reach extracts it needs to be put in here, 
and we also need to make sure that the naming 
matches what we have for previous months. 
So 1et me just first drop the link to this folder in the 
chat. 
I know how to use this properly. 
This I think this landmass link Is also in the JIRA 
t icket so you can find It there. 
So right now we have Facebook reach. 
MadOOlika Rawat 4:19 
You can. 
You can click on that attach symbol over left side 
of new. 
There·s an attached symbol lnbox itself. 
You can send it to. Yeah. you can create a link from 
here and share. 
KyleN9uyen 4,31 
•· 
This one. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thmk the Linda I sent yoo also 
worked. 
Some, yeah. Just check once you have access to 
that. OK.so. 
There's Facebook. so we just upload this in. 
And then we make sure that it has the same. 
So this is the month naming so. 
Rename this this 8504. 
Save and then your date. 
1B I 
Tron-Kap< 
CJ 


OK. 
So thll's faceboot. 
Arry questlOM 50 flf ~ 
Fac.t>oot? 
~R.w~t 126 
Ye<Jh. J!Al one question. 
We are downloading the Mme file for a different 
date range. nght7 
ICP,~ S;JJ 
Y.s. bualty. maU sure 11's ,vs:t the sa,ne thmg 
hlce you can like 90 11'110 lM this one and JUst. you 
know lunda hU spot. Ch«t. rt to see If it's pul,ng 
1n the nght data or not. 
But yeah. if s JUSI the same fomtilt. same fit.. same, 
s.ame columns. JUSt d1ff1rent date rilnge. 
OK.coot 
K. 
Moving on to Snapchat. 
But with Sn,pchat and T1ktok. it's a little bit more 
d1fflC\Jlt JUSI beause we can's realty pull data for all 
And somet,mn we nMd 10 go ,nto tMlf 1ndrvldual 
accounts and kind of SN If an x:count is Ktnle °' 
rw bftn ullang to Rachel to SH If we can get th,s 
data out somewhere ~se ~th« ttvough Pnsma to 
make this pro«ss HSI«. but as of nght now. 
Kinda JUSl spot. Ch«k PJff'/ account 10 SH ,f 
campa,gns are running or not. 
So for I know for a fKt that for kiwnta. 
~~bNt,runnmgrtS#'ICeso. 
For tlwit you go to tM account report MrM nght 
hen,. 
Saysreach. 
Um~ 
OK. And then do you cha~ tM dater~? 
So it must pull monthly first. 
Make sure that all the campaigns are being 
selected. 
Don't you need to change the dimensions or the 
metncs and then save and export7 
So with Snapchat. 11 doesn't really download the 
file fOf you, it Just crHtes a new tab. 
So from hefe then you download this file. 
SoWNtl did before 11thatOK1 
So this: is monthly. w you b~ go into Heh one 
ti'wt you've KCHS to. 
And you bocb ,ust do the same thing. 
Usualty fOf Snapchal. you wanna fof Reese. Vou 
wanna combint data from ~I accounts into one 
,poL 
So I'm Just bnda checking to see ,f there·s any 
ump,1ngns ruMiog in April. 
c~"""'9-
0K. 
So dearly there's there's no c.ampaigns running. so 
we don't need to worry abovt that nght now. Al of 
nght now. we c.an kind of tell whether. 
Campaign ,s runn,ng right now because we've 
been pushing to. 
The we've been pushing the media teams to kind 
of rename the accO\.lnt names to match new 
taxonomy. So as you can see the one 1s the only 
one that has the new taxonomy. 
Name 1t usually has the bral"ld name. 
The product code. the audience. the c.ampaign 
b~nd,ng. the platform and then of ours at the v«y 
ffld. as you c.an see fo, the p,e. the othff four ,ts 
following that u,- old format. 
So we an we we c.an bnda lr"IYtl"t that. 
These accounts aren t Kt1Ye. 
So with that. we only nMd to WOfT"J about this. 
Thenweun~ 
OK. And then this II a matter. So we JUSt c.ancel 90 
backto~nter. 
Go back to hefe. 
And now we pull )'Hf to date. 
AA the campaigns are be>lng ~ed. 
OK. And then we~ and export. 
OK.aW'HOffle. 
Um~ 
Yeah. 
0515.0K. 
These two kinda look the nme. 
I'm Just gonna rename them m here. 
OK.delete. 
Th,s monthly. so r u copy th,s. 
Go to downio.ds. 
So we dtd monthly furs. 
So the test. 
Change the date and then. This IS the SNpchat. 
0..- then we JI.ISi upload that fof' SNpchat. 
OK. And then we c.an I JUSI go ,n and make sure 
that rt's COilect. 
S,,. 
Everything looks C)OOd Mre. 
Eight impressions. 
656596010 and thts one should be biggef . 
._
lvtdtP#Rpnll:22 
K}¥, WNfs somethwlg here that would s!Mld out 
to you? 
That would mean that th11 IS wrong. 
Like say there's two lme Items. but what are? Ate 
there any examples of things you have that hke 
you said? Wait JOmethmg's messed up here. 
He's gonna have to know. 


"' KyleNgU)'fll 11:37 
•· 
That's a good question. 
You just kinda like. Yeah. I t hink you just kind of 
check it with like the. 
The past month data. 
So for example, when it is like, you know for year, 
today t he metrics should always be higher t han the 
monthly metrics. 
Campaigns it should always like. For example, 
we're in 202S right now and Andrew, I know you 
work in media tech. 
So like the the year should hopefully be all. 
... 
Andrew Ry"" 12:02 
Yeah. 
"' KyleNgu)'ff' 12:05 
• 
Like not all but like mostly be 25. If it's all 24. it 
might hint at like, oh, you've been pulling in the 
t he old data, so kind of stuff like that . 
._ Andrew Ryan 12:08 
Mm hmm. 
Gotcha. 
KyleNgu)'ff' 12:15 
Just kinda spot. Check it with with past data. 
And again 
._ Andrew Ryan 12:19 
OK 
KyleNgu)'ff' 12:21 
This process is not perfect. 
There have been times when we just didn't know 
for for sure, like if the data is correct or not. And 
that 's something t hat the media team and the 
activation teams need to QA. So the most we can 
do right now is j ust help making sure that the 
reach. 
Data is being pulled in and then we can just go 
from there. If there are any issues. 
._ Andrew Ryan 12:48 
OK sounds good. 
"' KyleNg">-' 12:'>4 
• And then last thing is Tiktok? 
_ 
Andrew Ryan 13:45 
And you have your robot. 
l knew1t. 
I'd catch you. 
~ 
KyteNgu)'ff' 13:51 
• I hate this. 
I mean and there's so many t imes and every t ime 
they j ust ask you for every Kate. 
There we go. 
Thanks. Peace. Thank you. 
OK 
You should have access to all of this. 
So I think from memory I know Cosentyx has stuff. 
Oh, I think the you don't need to do t he individual 
So that's really good. 
So when you go to monthly Tiktok RF, then for 
reach and frequency. 
Yes, I was right. 
So Tiktok is very similar to matter where you can 
click. you can pull reports out for all the accounts 
doing it individually 
So make sure that everything is being selected. 
OK seems to be putting to here. 
And then just look at the date range. choose the 
right one will be April. 
And export is out and excel format and. 
That's important. 
What? 
And t hen usually it's kinda same thing. 
All t he accounts are selected confirm. 
January to April. 
Support export. 
Perfect. And then just wanna make sure I'm not 
missing any stab monthly today or FRF? 
OK. good. 
Now right here. 
Change the date range. 
04/2 
3-0. 
And you to date. 
As I before. 
3-0. 
•• Andrew Ryan 16:45 
What's the reason behind the specificity of these 
naming conventions? 
~ 
KyteNgu)'ff' 16:51 
• Good question. So. 
That is because on the back end we have. 
We use data bricks to collect this data out of box. 
And ii looks at the file name to categorize which 
file belongs to what platforms and what is the date 
range for it . 
.. Andrew Ryan 17:17 
Mm hmm. 
KyleNg">-' 17:18 
So if it falls like a pattern, so if the pattern is like if 
it's like- an unknown pattern, or if it's like like a 


misspelling or like a letter, that's like a lower case. 
i 
Andrew Ryan 17:28 
Right 
KyleNguyen 17:29 
The derricks will not recognize 11 at al~ and the 
data will not come through. 
•• Andrew Ryan 17:34 
It's interesting to me t hat the dates are like 
everything's pretty consistent except the dates are 
touch different in the way they're formatted, and I 
do you think that's just because like maybe at 
some .1 developer made it one way and another 
made it the other or? 
Is it some other good reason? OK. 
~ 
KyleNguyen 17A7 
• 
Yeah. 
Yeah. I don't know why the name is fike different 
like. You will assume that like it will be just the 
same format which is different dates in different 
platforms. 
•• Andrew Ryan 17:55 
Yeah. 
I know it's not a battle worth fighting, but 1'mjust 
curious. I just. 
,._ KyleNgu~ 1am 
•· 
Yeah, we, we. 
.. Andrew Ryan 18:03 
But l guess I also have another question. 
Is any reason why these platforms aren't 
automated to just send rt to the box. upload on 
t heir own and we can just go in and rename and 
check t hem? 
KyleNgu~ 18.16 
That I have no idea . 
._ Andrew Ryan 18:18 
Right 
KyleNgu~ 18.19 
I think there might be a reason why we can's do it 
straight from the platforms to to date's . 
.,, Andrew Ryan 18:27 
But not even data bricks. But Just like box right 
here. you know. 
KyleNguyen 18:32 
Oh, I think for. 
My thing is because some of those accounts, like 
for example year to date, I don't think they have an 
option to send out 
Like that date range . 
.,, Andrew Ryan 18:50 
Oh. realty? OK 
KyleNgu~ 18,51 
Yeah, I know for Snapchat. 
like as you can see. 
It doesn't really. 
It doesn't have like a a date range. 
Like a default date range that says you today . 
._ Andrew Ryan 19:07 
Interesting, 
Well. 
KyleNgu~ 19:11 
Or even like monthly. As you can see right here. it 
has yesterday last seven days. last 14 days. last 30 
days, but not like previous month for view today . 
._ Andrew Ryan 19:19 
G. 
It\ Kyle Ngurn 19'20 
• I know these these platforms hate us . 
.. , 
Andrew Ryan 19'.21 
-
Ystl gsrotlminr 
The money they make and how simple that is. 
It's OK. 
Kyle Ngurn 19'.26 
Mm hmm. 
.. Andrew Ryan 19:26 
I'll go to forgive them. No, I won't. 
No. 
KyleNgu~ 19:31 
No, I feel like when these social platforms, when 
they create these like reports like managers and 
reports UL they hate us. They hate the marketers 
Because I think t hey're afraid. Like we actually look 
deep into the data. 
It's like. oh. we're not doing as well as we hope you 
._ 
Andrew Ryan 1!M5 
Yeah. they don't want us to know the truth. 
Yeah. 


But )'l!ah. so thats b,,K.illy the process. 
SoFacK>OOk11doMSNpct\it. Tdr.Tok. 
And thit should be 11.. 
Anc:l ltMn WMn you're doM. you. 
Mow tM to complt,t._ 
And thffl the next day. you look mto the. 
N2 dorama. 
So oat the one but the N21. 
And you can SH and you see 1f REACH is pulling or 
oat and 1f 11 1s tMn you're all set for the month. 
I'm JUsl gonna crute the rNm ooe. 
And do you ltnow rf If rt's. you ,-ist gonna do this. 
or you're 9C)ON do thrs for next month? 
... 
Andrirwit,_.

I personaly haw not bH!"I told II wil do this nut 
No wornes. I'm JUSt gonna Just create for now. 
And we can JUll crou that bridge when we get

K)'k,~ 
54 
Yeah. thlS IS a WfY quid: proc~s. 
You can eas~y do 11 w,thm I day. 
It doesn't take me that long. 10 be honest. 
It takes me hke usually as you can see like w,thm 
30mmutH, 
You can ~t 1t done. but rt's crucial that we get this 
dorw as soon H possible so that the sooal tHm 
has KctSS to the REACH d.11.1 because th@ Qt. 
process usuaty happens. 
I dont think ,n the first day of the month. but 
~theist. 
After like a wf!K they s1.1n qaing and then we start 
gemng tdceu ab«lt it. 
And, you know, breach 1s something that because 
rt's a manual process and ,f they don't se,e 11, they 
w,tl assume that tht,y haven't. 
We have no ,du. 
We have oo data. We '1:art getting bombarded

G CRlJS.Phrlltddphia.1111n<kpc:ndNK-,Mall.fl6.613.P-,nni"9lon ~ 
OK 
So I wanted to t.:lke ~ome time to go over our like 
monthly reporting tasks and Mee maintenance. 
ongoing maintenance that we do. 
This is gonna ~ 
just like a general high le11el like 
conversation about what? And I'll show you a dedc 
about what we·re doing and then. 
You wiH basically set up. 
Time to go over the individual points in 1his 
document. 
And so if you don't understand something, don·, 
worry. I'm not expecting you to. like, come away 
from this and and just start working. 
We'll we'll go through. 
We"II do like individual trainings on on each like 
piece of this, but I want to show you hke the 
involvement of of the team and what we're doing. 
Like you know. on that monthly basis and and how 
it plays in why it's important so. 
Let me just share my screen 
And t heo open the deck. 
Super happy that we have this deck because we 
did not have anything to reference these 1asks 
before. 
And now we do so 
Makmg progress here. 
So JU St a couple topics. overarching topics. 
So we'll go through manual reporting, uploads and 
checks, 
That we that we do. 
I think Kyle went through some of these already 
this morning. 
Morning. Then we'll get into the DMA and national 
like comparison that we do between 
Our snowflake data and the data coming directly 
from the platforms. Then we'll go through ongoing 
maintenance that we do and thenwe"II talk about 
ltcketing and JIRA best practices for the team 
So for monthly reporting. basically what is 
occurnng is our activation teams. So all of our 
search and social teams and programmatic teams. 
they"re responsible for QA. our dashboard data 
every month to ensure that the reporting is 
accurate compared to the individual Uis that 
they"re working in our Analy. 
Team. So you might hear us refer to them as an 0 
analytics. 
Are typically the terms we use for them. 
They then take. 
They then review the dashboards and then create 
ind1v1dua! insights based on those delivery and 
those benchmarks that are located within the 
dashboard 
So they"re basically making stories for the client on 
how we're perform mg as an agency. 
Our team is responsible for ensuring that the 
dashboards populate the necessary data every 
month, and we perform some overarching qa's to 
help catch any issues that are ocrurring. 
A channel or a dal.:l stream issue Pfior to the 
kickoff that happens with the activation teams. 
So every 1st of 1he month or business first 
business day of the month. you·n see me kind of 
reach out to everybody and say. hey. we're in t he 
Aprit"s reporting cycle or like in June, 1"11 say we·re 
in May's reporting cy,::!e. You know we have to. 
Start our monthly tasks too. Ensure that 
The that our activation teams can go io and. 
OK. 
So some of the pre monthly reporting tasks that 
we do. So these are some of the tasks that we"re 
working on at that start of the month before the 
kickoff happens with our activation teams. 
So we have a few manual reports and uploads 1hat 
we do on this account. 
So the majonty of the data that we get into our 
dashboards comes from API connections and 
batch file delivecy from PUBMEDIA. 
Or directly from a dashboard APl's. but not all the 
data. 
We can receive those ways are {LIi the way that we 
need it for Novartis. 
So we do additional manual and automated 
reporting uploaded directly from the different Uis 
So below I listed the UI reports that were 
responsible for so every month on. 
The within the first two business days of each 
month we upload 
Social REACH reports for Meta. Snapchat. Snapchat 
and TikTok. We upload those to box. 
They get sent to databricks and then they're 
delivered into our dashboard into our dashboard 
pla1form. 
Then we also have a couple reports set up in 
search and they·re delivered daily to our 
dashboard platform for specific date ranges. 
So we have search impression share we also call it 
sov. 
Search conversions. search DMA and search 
CJ 


campaign overview aU come from automated 
reporting in SA 360. 
So these reports have to be uploaded and checked 
within the first two business days of each month 
prior to the data prior month·s data set. 
So we do have to ched: to see where if we're 
getting like for right now for May between May 1st 
and May 2nd. we have to make sure that we have. 
April data in Datorama. 
So sooa! reach uploads. I did have Kyle f.l:'I up 
some time to walk through this earlier. so we do 
have to klg into each platform. 
And manually generate the report each month. 
l know he went over this a littte bit. but we can't 
set up automated reporting 
For REACH. because the social platforms don't just 
auto indude new accounts. which is realty 
anointing, I asked that question to Kyle. 
Yeah. it's so annoying that they just don•t allow 
you to do that In their platform. 
So you have to go lfl arid select everythmg arid 
then rerun the report. 
If you're creatirig a report for the first time, we 
have a bunch of previous month examples on box. 
So 1f you for some reason you have to generate 
the report yourself, you can 
There's plenty of reports to reference in order to 
set up. like a new report. For the most part. 
You should be able to see reports that other 
people have created within the social account but 
if for some reason you can't arid you have to set 
up one yourself in your own view. yau can follow 
some of the reports on box and I added the box 
link. 
There and you can. 
You can see the different ones. 
You'll need to do both a year to date report and a 
monthly report in each U!. 
So Just a reminder, we can only do this for Vena. 
Snapchat and Tik.tok. 
Orice that Is uploaded to box. thafs reach data 
should populate within our dashboard within two 
days after after upload. It could be sooner. 
We did speed up some of the processes recently, 
so it might be there sooner. but you·ll just need to 
check. 
That we just checked that the social reach 
reporting is populating for the last month w1thm 
the dashboard. 
So I did take a screenshot of the social. 
Dashboard. And again we'll go over this more in 
depth. but when you navig.Jte to the social 
dashboard. you should be able to click campaigri 
bre.Jch and select the month that you Know the 
most recent morith for reporting. 
So I would change this top field to April full month 
of April and then once l do th.JI I should be .Jble to 
see campaign reach listed here. 
If for some re;Json some of them say iero. don't 
worry about it. If you see some at least. 
Some camp.Jign reach hsted there. 
We should be good to proceed. 
You might see a zero because maybe that 
campaign is not live this month. 
Thall! be a check. that the activation team has to 
check. and alert us .Jbout. but as long as we see a 
maJOrity of these fields popul.Jting, we are good to 
go. If we see zeros <Kross the board. something's 
wrong. And then we have to look into why. 
The reach is and making its way to the dashboard 
So yeah. 
So that's all we have to do there. 
We just have to upload .Jnd then just check that 
t he one column is populating for the month of the 
previous month and we're good 
Conftdenc:e that everything show up across the 
board that doesn't that actualty I think it's onty 
happened once and I think it was because. 
We like uploaded the report a little weird into box 
lik.e I think like we somebody accidentalty tike put 
it s.omewhere else inste.Jd of the folder it was 
connected to. 
Typic.Jlly we see it 
lfit breaks. it's USU.lily. 
Maybe data Brooks went down for the last couple 
days and we have to get s.omebody to !ik.e we run 
the process. Kyle had mentioned that social like 
like those monthly ones. They want usually pretty 
quick. So and you say it tak.es two days each time. 
So like 11? 
There's an error then that's gonna. 
Praveena t.Jkes it 
That almost puts us at S days. 
Yeah. like right there 
So how Is there a way to like have s.omebody 
manually push it through for getting realty title in 
time to update this? 
Or is there something else we C.Jn do on this call? 
lme.Jntypicalty. 
So if there if we have an issue and we're like, hey, 
we have to do this in the first two business days 
because we have to do reporting Juel:: off. if we're 
running into an issue and we can't solve it we just 
we have .Jn alert that let. 
Like we have a process where we notify the team 
of lik.e you can go in and QA for this month. But 
except for these things right now be<:ause there's 
So it's not like 1f we ;Jre. if Wi:''re running into issues 
with something, we just have to be like proactive in 
letting the teams Know th.JI Iii«:, hey, you can QA 
except for the followmg .Jnd then Just letting them 
know once it's fixed. OK. 
So yeah. 
We've had that happen before in the past where 
hk.e something was broken. 
It h<lppens usually every month with at least one 
channel where either something·s brok.en or we're 


mrssmg dau fOf IOfflethlng. and W!,ust kt them

companng th• fellowing metncs Impre,ss. 
Clicks. 
And sp«ld Ind for~ We rit only doing II let. 


Research, social and programmatu:. because those 
that spend comes directly from the platforms that 
cost metric comes directly from the platforms. 
whereas for campaign manager we rely on a 
different platform to pull in cost. That platform is 
Prisma. 
So we're just QA ING the data from the different 
platforms. I guess the data that we have for those 
platforms in Snowflake and we are ensuring that all 
of the discrepancies are less than 3%. 
If there is a discrepancy above 3%. we have to look 
into it. 
We might be missing data for a certain date. 
We might be missing data for a certain campaign. 
We might be missing data for a certain account so. 
Basically that QA that occurs w1!1 give us the 
insights to then troubleshoot where the issues 
ocrornng. 
This one has to be done within the first three 
bu~irK>« d.a~ of <>.ach month 
Just so that we can start troubleshooting or let the 
team know that we need additional time to solve 
for a specific platform or a specific channel. 
Again, we'll set up some time to go through this in 
depth because it is a lot It's a lot to go through 
t oday, but there's basically three steps. You"!I 
generate reports from each platform and upload It 
tobolC. 
There are directions on box that tell you what like 
if you can access the reports in lhe platform, what 
those reports are named. 
What you have to do to up update them before 
you export them out of the platform. 
That's all located there and you'll just export those. 
You'll update those reports from each UI you"ll 
upload them in t he box, and then there·s quenes 
that you'll run in Snowflake to generate the data 
for the platform. 
So there's like specific queries for each platform. 
Those are all listed on Box as well. 
So you could just copy and paste into snowflake 
and just hit run. 
And it'll generate the data for you. and then you'll 
;ust compare and compile it. 
So you'll I think as of date to date, Chaitanya and 
Pwva have been doing X lookups based on 
campaign IO"s and placement IO"s to compare the 
data sel's and then I know chatanya's trying to 
work on automating this a little bit so that we Don. 
Have to do the X lookup and we can j ust run this in 
and data Brix. 
And then just look at the like figure out where the 
where the discrepancies are, but unlit then. 
We"ll do the we"II do the X loolc: up on it. 
So thafs all I have for the for that piece. And then 
while we·re doing the the OMA and the national 
level checks, we're we're also doing this DMA code 
check. So when you're pulling data at a snowflake, 
you'll be able to see If the OMA data that you. 
Pumng is showing weird stuff like unknowns or 
Nulls. 
If. 
That if you see that in that Snowflake generated 
report. we have to update a DMA file to include 
AOOO. 
Just noting that there's no code, it's basically area 
code available or DMA code available, because if it 
says unknown or if it has any other like alpha 
numerical make up, it kind of breaks Novartis's. 
Thing that they're doing. 
So we just need to make sure it"s all numbers. 
But again. we'll go through that. 
That's not as important as the. 
As this piece, so this is typically done 1st ;md then 
we j ust kin<l of revisit !his data, the OMA data after 
the the QA is done. 
So again, we'll talk a little bit more about this as 
the month progresses. 
So that's I'm gmng to pause here again. 
l don't e~pect you guys to to know any of this. but 
do you have any general questions about any of 
t hese tasks? 
0~ 
Al! right. cool. 
Al! right. we'll get into the alerts in the ticketing 
So basically we've those are the steps that we need 
t o do before we get to the reporting month. 
So now. 
We"ve done our part. 
We have identified we've done everything we need 
t o do. We have identified any overarching issues 
with the data. 
So once we do everything in those first few days. 
we enter monthly reporting kick off. 
So we talk to the analytics team. 
We let them know. 
Hey, we have done all that we need to do before 
t his monthly report. However, we're having some 
issues with the following data, 
So we lrst out everything that we're waiting on. 
So this is a perfect example that we had In 
February where we had a couple issues we and 
they were all for social. 
We had an issue where we were missing 2 days 
worth of data so we were waiting for that to be 
resolved. 
Then we were waiting for. 
Some backfills for some accounts that just went 
1ive, but we didn't have the data yet so we had 
reached out to PL media to be. 
Litce we need this data and they were taking 
forever. 
So we didn't have that done yet. 
And theo we had an issue with Reddit spen<l, and 
we had an issue where somebody had requested a 
TiKTnk mf>fri(" in thPir rPnortinn th;,t wf> rn11ll1n't 


get It added yeL 
So these are the things that we·11 note to the team 
when reporting starts so that they know, OK. I can 
go m and QA everythrng else except fOf sooal 
sooal needs to wait. 
Or rf it wasn·t if 1t was Just us m1SS1t19 a couple 
drfferent accounts. 
They knew, OK. we can go m and QA all the other 
brands. but we have to wart to QA thesf! brands. So 
it JOSI gwes them a heads up. 
So we heads up so we can proceed and not delay 
the whole reporting like the whole reporting cyde. 
So we'll notify them m teams and we'll have a 
conversat1on with them. 
We have like a monthly or a weekly call with them. 
so we'll notify them there as well. 
And the-n once we do that our A and O team 
sends out a kick off e-mail. 
To the aclivat10n team. 
So they sent an alert out saying. hey. this 1s our 
monthly media reporting lockoff. 
You are good to start QA ING. But Please note of 
the foHowmg issues and then. 
They they'll JUSt let us let them evel)'ooe know that 
they can start where there's no issues.. 
Once they do that. the actJvauon teams get a JIRA 
ticket. 
Basically that is hke. hey, here's your JIRA ticket 
nobfymg you that you have a brand that you nffd 
AOA for this month. 
They'll start their JIRA process w,th that tld:et and 
,fthey have any •~ues while QA the dashboard. 
theyw~I. 
let us know and they submit a ticket to us. 
Via Smartsheet, 1t 1s not m JIRA 
There rs a reason for that. 
Yeah. 1t'!i.. 
I know it's con110luted but. 
We we need a form. 
Because they don't give us information. 
Well, so we can't just be hke send messages or 
lake it because we're not going to get what we 
require out of them. 
So we have them do 11 through smartsheet 
because we can do a form. 
It's. I knoW. people say have to. Yeah. they have to 
pfOVlde the the certain mformat100 so. 
It's a httle contusing. 
Hopefully we"H get rt figured out because I know 
we are tl)'lng to get our JIRA upgraded where we 
can do a form so we don't even have to worry 
about that but. 
W!!'llffl!lfthat. 
We'll see if that happens, but yeah. exactly. 
But yeah. so nght now we and I and we'll talk a 
little bit more about this at 1he end because there's 
there"s more informat10n about 11. 
But basically. think of it this way. 
Start of the reporting, like if we need something 
from actrv.itron. we're setting them a JIRA ticket. 
But if they need something from us, they're 
sending us a smartsheet ticket. 
So it's hke we ticket them and JIRA. They trek.et us 
1n spark sheets. 
So yeah. So we'll talk a little bit more about that 
but they get an e-mail, they get a JIRA ticket. 
They know that they can start QA. 
Again. as they QA. they'll send us. 
If they have ISSUH, they'll send us a the issue \Ila 
smartshfft and we get we get it ,n a trad:: like. 
This IS our 111ew. so we will start worbng on it .ind 
trying to figure 11 out. And then every Friday during 
reporting. we will send .in e-mail out just alertmg 
eve<ybody of any outstanchog 1s$Ues that w-e h.we 
gotng on from an over. agam from a channel level 
down. 
To a ticket level ,ssue. So this at the bottom is what 
we send m an e-mail. 
I'll fo,ward you guys the e-mail. 
So you can see rt but Just kind of. 
like stoplight type of notrfications of like. lf there's 
an no ,mpact to a channel. 1t's a green dot. If 
there·s some channel impact. it's a yellow dot and 
1f it's a full channel impact it's a red dot. 
So red dot means they can't QA at all. 
Yellow means they can QA but JUSt some stuff is 
messed up ano green means !hey can QA. 
There's no issues. 
And then wherever there's a yellow or red, we will 
have to. We'll list out what that what that !Slue. 
ls al the bottom and bke what partner ifs 
impacting what's exactly affected the date range of 
How like of whars affKted and then when we 
expect ,1 to be resolved, so we send that out every 
Friday and we JUSI notify them of any updates and 
then hopefully by the end of the month. ,t goes 
from. ~re·s a hst of issues to everyth,ng's been. 
"'°"""· 
You're you're good. 
And reporting should be accurate. 
OK. so that IS the general kKkoff for reportmg. 
So let me get into the ongoing ma,ntenal"ICe stuff 
that we do. 
So. 
What we should be doing, but we currently aren't 
becausf!' It's been difficult to do. 
It's JUSt a couple people, but what we'll start doing 
rs we'rf!' 901119 t o do daily data stream checks, 
wti1ch basically means in our data, Rama. 
So both our Novartis data dashboard and our 
agency skle dashboard, we have data stre,m set 
They run au1oma11catly every day. 
Somewhere between. 
fvefV two hours to twice I dav. 


What we just need to do is make sure that they're 
running, that they continue to run in there 
successfully running. 
Sometimes they breakdown and we don"t realize it 
nght away. 
And then no artists is like we haven"t gotten data 
from this data stream in hlc:e 4 days and I'm like. 
That"s because ifs been broken. 
It's been running and when nobody noticed it 50 
we just we'll just need to check the data streams to 
make sure that they"re running. 
So this is like it's a pretty simple task. 
It's just like we need to find the data in the 
Novartis dashboard. 
We would Just need to naV1g.ite to where the data 
streams are listed and again we'll go through this 
more and we'll go through this more in depth at a 
later time, but we'll Just need to go to the Novartis 
Statarama dashboard, find the data streams that 
startwath. 
N2 and make sure that. 
All the run statuses show 1s sU(:cessful. 
Last run date should be in the past the past two 
day~ The toggle should be blue for enabled data 
And then there's a way to look at the execution 
histoiy. 
It should show that the last reports that ran were 
successful. 
If we see that a data stream has failed or does not 
look like it's running properly. 
We'll talk with you know, we can. 
We'll talk more. but we'll have you open up a JIRA 
ticket. 
And a!>Sign 1t to the manager so we can look into 
why it's faiting. 
So that's for the Novartis data, Rama. 
We'll want to do the same thing for the N2 
datorama. 
The only difference is that the feet the data 
streams are labeled a little differently. but we want 
to check all of the same stuff. 
Same exact process 
If there's an issue, we·u open up and there·s going 
to be an ongoing JIRA ticket and you'll just be able 
to add a ticket in there. Jf there is an issue with a 
certain data stream. 
Yep. So that's that's one of the ongoing tasks. 
We also have a social live tracker, So what this is is 
that this 1s an e-mail that we get every day. 
sometimes twi<:e a day. 
That it sends an automated response out to our 
team and the social team. And it says, hey. here's a 
bunch of accounts that. 
We see. 
Have a start date. current a current or a start date. 
In the past but we have no data for it 50 we need 
to get data for these accounts and then it'll also list 
the number of accounts for the social team. 
showing them we have to start dates here so we 
can't start monitoring if we should have data. 
Because we're missing start dates and this is alt 
connected to placement manager, so it's jU'5t 
pulling infonnation from where they're building 
out their taxonomy for their campaigns. 
It's j ust pulling information out of there to then 
alert us if. like we shoo Id see data or if we. 
Or if we have a start date issue so. 
If a campaign shows here. 
There's two sections. so they're split out. So the 
first section is where. 
We have a start date but no data 
The second section is we have no start date so we 
can't monitor the first section if the campaign 
shows here we need to open up a ticket with pub 
media to get data for the campaign. That basically 
just means that they've launched. 
We didn't realize it and we need to ask pub media 
to get the data for u~ 
For the second section, there·s no action. 
For our team that is solely for. 
Social to let them know that we need start dates 
here so that we can start monitoring the campaign 
That"s all of this e-mail does. but rt does it every 
day in hopes that we can get data again. 
The reason why we have to do this is because 
social is nuanced. 
They don't They're not efficient 
So, like social doesn't allow you to like it. It doesn't 
allow you to auto select campaigns for reporting. It 
doesn't allow you to automate. 
To get data. 
So like, it's just they're all veiy nuanced. 
So we kind of have to. 
We kind of have to babysit the social campaigns a 
little bit because there's not automation there. 
I'm not going to get into this right now because 
this is a lot and I don't. This process is a lot, so I'm 
not going to get into this right now. 
But Malika. you won"t have to woriy about 
classifications. 
This this is more. 
This is a lot of manual work that occurs, but 
Andrew this will be. 
This will end up being your bread and butter so 
that light reading is set me on some of this so. 
Yeah. So we'll, we'll talk a little bit more about this. 
but this is what Kyle has been really focused on. 
And hlce Jackie and I have all been taught. 
We've all been talking about this. 
This is in need of a major cleanup. 
Number one. But #2, we're also tiying to see if we 
Not do this in the dashboard anymore. If we can 
move this process out of the dashboard because it 
creates a whole additional. it creates a whole 


add1t1onal process. 
But it's not the best platform to do it in and we've 
we've learned that over the course of like a year 1s 
that it's just bulky and it slows down the 
dashboard platform so. 
Cool. So yeah, I'll skip that. 
Too, and I'll skip that. 
And we'll skip that too. 
We'll go over that at a later time as well. 
OK. 
Don't be alarmed at this table. 
This table will be your best friend in the long run. 
Basically what I did here is. 
I split out all of the ,hannels that we are 
responsible for for data. 
And I made a number of referen,e columns so you 
have the report channel and then you have where 
t his where tne spend is coming 
From so it'll tell you exactly what. where we're 
referencing for cost or for spend, so digital. 
We use Prisma for any kind of direct campaign and 
we use the DSP platform for any programmatic 
campaign for spend for paid search. We gel spend 
from SA 360 from paid social. We get the from the 
paid social platform. 
So it tells you exactly where we're relying on the 
source of truth. 
For spend and then there is the activities that we 
care about for each channel. 
So these are the activities that we talk about the 
most so like impressions. clicks, video 
completions. viewability. all of that. it'll tell you 
exactly what we care about for each chann.el the 
Where that source of truth is for that activity 
And then finally the snowflake tables. 
So these are the tables that you are going to use. 
To look up this information. 
So this is where like again if you need to find out 
what dat a we've collected 
For digital. 
For impressions and clicks for DCM. you're gonna 
check these tables if you need 
Digital. 
Viewability. 
For double verify, you're gonna ,heck this table. 
So there's a lot of tables in snowflake that you 
don't need lo worry about. 
These are going to be the tables that you're going 
t o be in the most so and then 
For for paid social is NC. Note there is a note in 
t his deck that breaks out all of the different tables 
bQ<:~u~" it w;>' just w~y too long for sOO:il, but this 
will be your best friend in the long run. 
This is something we didn't have for a while, and 
Kyle and r were just like. 
Where do we reference this? 
Where 1s this coming from? 
And we finally nailed it down South. You'll be using 
t his a lot. 
OK. And then this is less. 
This is like toshira and smartsheet And again we'll 
we'll do like a full metalika. 
We'll talk a little bit more about JIRA and 
Smartsheets. 
In the long run we'll get yoo kind of onboarded 
with JIRA first. 
But maybe not. 
You might end up being on smart sheet. 
I'll talk to Jal anya and we'!! figure it out. 
But basically we use J!RA to track our internal 
work.load. 
So you'll see. This is basically our dashboard. 
Eveiyone witl get access to this link or or to our 
project and everybody we track all of our Internal 
work within JIRA so we create. 
Different tickets either 
You know you'll create it yourself. 
Or your manager will create one for you and it just 
takes you through the different ticket types that 
t here are. So Natalie for you will create the tickets 
for you and assign them out so you won't have to 
worry about this. And and Andrew. I know I went. 
Through this the other day with you, but basically 
we're Just using ep1C$ for large proJects or ongoing 
proJectS and then we're using stories for like those 
smau tasks or story points within. 
A large project. 
Or an ongoing project and then a subtask. If 
t here's additional work that needs to be done 
within the individual story. 
Couple important things about tickets. So we use 
labels a lot. 
So you know, there are a couple labels that we are 
constantly using for our team. 
So we're using current year data enablement and 
then both Novartis and N2 and then just as a 
reminder that if you have a ticket and you need to 
!eave a comment or you need to, you know you 
are. we're waiting for a response from you.just 
REM. 
To. 
You know, add a lot of descriptions. 
Like more information you include in a ticket 
The better attachments are helpful. You know, j ust 
be cognizant of the priority of the ticket If it's a 
high priority or if it's a low priority. you want to do 
the high priority ones first. 
The tickets will have plan start and end date, r,o on 
the right hand side. So when you get a ticket make 
sure to reference when it's due. 
And then youjust make sure. 
Is assigned to tne proper person, and that you·re 
moving in through the d ifferent statuses, but 
Madelik.a will go through this a little bit more in

We ticket Ktwltion ind ,n,..-1, and then tM)' ticnt

actually go to JIRA for this. 
So tNS 1s what we .,.,..,e t1lklig about the other day 
where Heh. 
Each chal"IMI has thew own r~1ng r.b:shboani 
So what I've bffn doing and this IS bke I ~tti.. 
ted!OUS and fflayM you can find a way to make 
this better but. 
Ba~ly~month. 
On the lodtoff day. l'w bffn doing rt on the k1d:off 
day b«.Juse thfll t~ get confused. 
You lcoow how you know how those teams are? 
What I've been doing 11 I go into !he epic so the 
epic 1s pretty much tike the parent ticket for each 
report. like eactl channel. 
So 1 go mto here and I go down to WM<e Ill of the 
like children stonH are ~nick! and rw been JUSI 
gotnglOl<keMarch. 
And l'w been Ope!W'lg then, off in 11'11ndMClull 
~--
And clor11ng them and mabng an April bd:.i and 
awgning rt bac.k to the the IHm. 
It woncs. You know Its 11 S JUSI JI takes like proWbty 
rd s.ay about an hour. 
Amont~ 
Just auigntng thHe out. 
So If you thmt of a better way to do IL let 1M 
know. 
But ~sicllly Ill I do ti t JUSI clone rt. 
I change 11 from Februaty or MMch to Apfll and 
<hen. 
Ch.Jnge the the. 
Ch.Jnge the due date and asS19n 11 back to the 
Person with. So •f I open March here. rt's a side to 
Joey. But the ong1nal ~son who 0Wl'\5 the ttCk.i IS 
Wtuch would ther\. for this one Cohn. 
TM reason why rt's done this way tS WilCally what 
the'(r@ doing 1s we·r. sigrwig the map a tJCket and 
they have a checklist on the ngltt hand Mde thaL 
Their hey. 1iuwe·re Ilk•. 
we.·re qUN,ng thn. 
Thiststhisisgoocl. 
This IS good. -·-
And then at the end. 
The.y ass,gn the tldr.et Oller to analytics so that they 
know aNlyt.a knows. 
Oh. they completed 'lllhal they needed to. 
And then rt's kind of like the bi QA 1oncl of thmg 
where like multiple people own the ttd:et. 
And then analytics will dose the ticket once they're 
done.. 
The insights so. 
So yeah. so I'm I'm doing that every month and 
then. 
I am then also at the top of r-1ery dashboard 1s a 
like due date. 
There's a ulendar. 
1"1 moot the calendM over to )'OU, but tMn rm,ust 
dwngtng this to may. 
Tht5 n; due by tM date ,n May and that's IL 
Just so they have another p&Kt to reference rt. 
Gre..tt news IS that tNy'vie bHn reaRy good. 
The.yVe been getting better at actually completing 
the t1ctc:et. So like rm I've been impressed. 
It's only been hke a, __ 
l.Jke.. 
Repe.atotfenotrl. 
And then I Ulked Wllh Swat\ who·s our proJ«I 
manager th6 morning and they'r. gonna they'rt1 
goon.a send out thtee days. before the due date. 
Theyre gonna pull• JIRA report and send ,t to us 
and .,.,,._·re. We can tel them. OK. send 11 out to 
~e)(cept for. 
This person, this person and this person. hke 1f they 
have open tld::ets with us, 
And then they'll send oul a not1ficat10n saying hlce, 
hey, your tickets ar...,·t done yet and then lhey'H 
send 1L they"ll .send 1t out one more. time., three 


where's your QA like red alert? Like you haven't 
completed anything. 
But it 's it's pretty. 
It's pretty. 
I feel like a pretty much. 
Mimics kind of what we're doing with like the Bl 
QAS like, except they're just going to a dashboard 
to QA instead of taxonomy to QA s.o. 
Yeah. So we doing this and then? 
Their QA so I'm going to skip all this because this 
is literally what we just talked about. 
And then. 
So if they're running into issues with QA so if they 
have this ticket open. 
And like they get to hear. And they're like, oh. I 
have an issue with Luna tha raising or missing cost. 
They have to hold onto this ticket until we resolve 
the issue with them via the smartsheet. 
llecause what was happening 1s they were like 
blowing through the process and assigning it over 
to analytics. 
Dialysis was hke there's an issue here and I'm like. 
they're like, I was like. yeah. did they sign the ticket 
over? And they're like, yeah. they say he completed 
it. And I'm like, yeah, but there's an issue. So. 
So yeah, so they have to hold onto the ticket. but 
they'll submit the issues. 
So like basically this is twofold. 
It's Just like assigning share tickets out to them. 
And then. 
And then just checking the smartsheet and seeing 
if they're assigning any issues over to us. 
Smartsheel is pretty. 
We're. I think Kyle and I are gonna clean it up a 
little bit. 'cause. It's a little outdated. Michael had 
originally set it up. 
Where1s1t? 
They have a form and then they send everything 
So this is what I did. 
I give you access to this yet. 
l haven't seen this one. 
OK.no. 
OK. 
So this ts what Kyle has been owning for the most 
part. 
l'U jump m and handle stuff every once m awhile. 
but basically when they submit a ticket to us, it 
signs a ticket ID to it like we don"! do anything 
there. 
Michael set that up. 
It just tells us who sent the ticket in. 
We grab the ticket like dependmg on who is going 
to work on fl and then the description of the issues 
are all to the right. 
So you'll see like exactly what the report name is, 
that is having the issue. 
If it is search or social or display or video. 
And then it'll give you a description of the issue. 
Can you take a guess if they're good at describing 
the issue? 
And found. 
Please check. 
Yeah. So ifs and and the screenshots are usually 
But but yeah, this is what they sent through to us. 
And this is like what we'll go ahead and resolve 
We have a few statuses. 
That we use so when it comes to steroid, it'll be 
Then we'll put 11 in progress as we're working on it 
If we have to send rt over to pamedia. 1',"e'l1 select 
that. If we send a response bade, we'll just put it 
that it's pending response from submitter. If we 
know it's an issue that we are not going 
Within this month, mm hmm. We"ll just put 
pending for next report. 
Close means that we we finished it. 
Bad:!ogs means we can·t get to it. 
It will get to it later. 
Like sometimes they ask like this is formatting is. 
No, like wait. So we'll put it in bad:log, we'll get to 
11 when we get to it, 
But yeah, and then with closed we once we close it. 
We should only close tickets if it's resolved. 
So just check off the resolve button and then 
there's a couple of resolution updates. So 1f we 
have to make an update to the dashboard, we'll 
just check that you can ignore the Excel report that 
doesn't exist anymore. 
Same thing there. So we'll take those out. 
No options data refresh just means pub media like 
Comedia did had to work on it. 
No updates required. 
That happens when it's a user error and then no 
response 
Sometimes we'll close the ticket out because I just 
you'l1 respond to them and be like. 
Are we either need more? 
Yeah. they just don't 
They just don't get back to you, so. 
So yeah. 
So that's pretty much it, 
That's just like, that's like the bulk of the process. 
I I know it's a lot for one day. but like basically we 
do a coupte tasks at the beginning of the month 
that are manual. 
We check everything that we can at an overarching 
level be like is there data there for April? 
Is there no data there for April? 
If the data is there like great based on what the 
what our PGD people do with the QA like all of 
that stuff. 


You just want to check before they kick off, 
because if there is any type of issue. we don't want 
them. 
Cue it. 
We don't want waste their time. right? 
So like we want to let them know, hey, we have XY 
and Z to figure out but proceed with everything 
else. 
They start working on it. 
They alert us of any issues. 
They're supposed to do this within their special 
alert us and do their QA within a certain time 
frame. 
Will you help resolve the issues? They finish their 
QA.AO writes. 
Their insights? They send it ove-r to Novartis. 
You repeat it all again nexl month so. 
It's a. It's just we've gotten better at it and I think 
the more that Kyle and l have worked on it. 
I think we resolved a lot of the we have- some 
pretty big issues last year and I think it just came 
down to the switching of hands. 
Oh, somebody's putting in a ticket. 
Oh, no, 1et me take out this dothesline. Oh, oh, 
God. 
New 
OK. let me get out of here. 
No. OK. 
1 don·t know. 
But yeah, so I think we have- a lot of. 
Really big issues last ~ar. but l feel like we've 
we've kind of figured 11 out like we had stuff that 
was lasting like 2-3 months because like we just 
didn't even know where to begin 
What's the ideal amount of time people would 
take it versus what usually happens? Yeah, so. 
Ideal would be just like a couple days. 
OK 
The we've had some issues that have been open 
for like months. 
With pub media mostly pubmedia issues, but I 
can't. 
It's like weird. 
Like, let me let me s.ay pub media. 
Like who exactly are you going to?Yeah, let me. 
Let me. t'm gonna stop !hat recording.

I gave a guy who first started Andrew, 1f you~ 
know Andrew, I gave him like the first thing he I 
sa,d to him was you need to fix our HCP. 
@ 
J,cqueline ~
ron startrd tranKJ1flllon 
f) :;~:;:; 
w:\~ke four yurs ago. 
And so he was like, OK. Jackie. 
He helped out from. like. getting all of our NPI 
data straight. making sure 11 had like our Pnsma 
ID's in Jt and all of oor unique ID's going. 
And then David Haiberman was: a 9l1Y who was 
working. 
X 
Who theo built up a burx::h of log1c that did what? 
Ultimately Chns has brought home for us here. 
Called migrated spend and like VO Teresa, some of 
us have be-en talking about this for hke S years 
Or more they've ~n talking about for like 8 
So this 1s a C\llminahon of a lot of thought so. 
Bear with us 1f Jt's confusing be<:ause 11 1s confusmg 
and the whole idea here 1s what we're trying to 
so~e for is that we have. 
We hav-e the the thing we always say is. 
We ha~ spend. 
Where we're our spend and delivery do not follow 
each other. So we might buy something in January 
and we'll have spend 1n Pnsma in January. 
But it doesn't go live until March 
We will have spend in a package callftt a btllmg 
line item and theo we will have packages w1th111 
that billing line item where we actually have. 
Of the speod. 
Oh. sorry. Where we actually have the performance 
data we have spend m packages called production 
fees that we need to tie together to spend in like 
the actual buy and what was live. 
And so we·ve wn11en up a series of ruJes here to be 
able to move the sper,d around. 
To match where we have NPI level data. 
Data. lfwe have MPI level data. If we don't haft 
NPI data. ti's try,ng to match the data to the DCM 
data. If we don1 have. 
DCM data. 
If s trying to match the data to the planned untt~ 
Now the problem rt comes. Well actually now rm 
going l o transfer II probably over to yOtJ now, 
Chris, to talk throogh some of the sceoanos of how 
we like talked about this logic here because wheo 
we start looking at a campaign that's like live nght 
There could be spend in January. 
And there could be spend in December, but there's 
ooly PLO data. 
For March. 
So how how do we divvy out the spend for 
scenanos hke thaH 
Yeah. because this hierarchy here 1s all historically 
looking. 
We don't know. In the future how much of the 
delivery will have for each of these. 
So what do we do whEn we're 1n a s1tuat1on like 
this? 
Where rf thts 1s today? 
You know some stuff about the delivery m the past, 
but we still have the plan. 
The plan IS still runmng and then we have this 
ambiguoos window where we·re still rol!ecting 
data. 
But we, but 11 may not necessarily be done. 
So we have to figure out how do we 111 JO a 
migrated spend sceoano. 
How are we handling? 
The spend in this section wrsus this section aod 
Just because we may have a couple new faces here. 
So this is h1stoncally look1og on the hierarchy of 
how we we basically who wms on g1V1og credit. 
But realty. all the spend other than fOf 
programmatic is at a pad@ge level and we waot to 
be able to see the ~
nd. 
By package by mooth, by placement by tactic by 
channel and subchannel within specific to the PLO 
data. We want to be able to see what that spend 1s 
based on migrating the spend first of that package 
level and then. 
Breaking Jt down because the way this all worts is 
realty we use th1S logic to migrate spend only at 
the package level. 
After that eve,ything's getting credit evenly based 
on ex1st1ng because that's all evenly spread. 
So 1f this packag• has three placement~ every 
placement that's active fOf a part1C\llar month will 
give equal spend. 
So Just dMde 11 by three and then rf 1t depending 
on the number of tactics for that placement. ifs 
evenly spread. 
~1

CJ 
I::: 


OlilnflK HU)' spread. 
Subc:Nnnl'ls .wnty spNd. 
SothltswhatM·re uy,ng toaccomptish ~ 
And to do that. If we 1oo1t. 
Example pYn from Pnsm.a. 
This tS without looking 1t 1ny delivery at an. 
This IS purely whit. 
How WIS 11 entertd into Prisma? 
I realize !hat these say 2024 dates. but we're going 
to 1mag1ra that we'r• m 2025 stepping through 
th1S and lfflng how the data would update. 
Depending on what month were m. But with this 
bev,g Ml up fOf COHnpta. 
Fot" whatl'Wf rHSOI\ rt WU set up with a who'e 
bunch of unrts fOf four months. wrth no~ 
And thffl the rest of the un1n. which 1s pretty 
much other thin 0.Cembef, IS the same amount. 
That's where we 1t1rt to reaffy see the spend. 
But if we had delivery w1th1n these fir5t four 
months. then we wanna be able to give 1t spend so 
that the metna are correct when we·re calculating 
cost PERS f« whltrter metnc yot.fre measunng. 
And If rt dtdn·t quite delrvff IS evenly as thcs within 
the.e moot.hi. M 1lso wann1 make sure we re 
aca,rat.ty showing the spend correlated with the 
lruedel!VflYwtlhlnthesemonths.nottlwseven 
spruding of spend or UNts fof' ttus time penod. 
So what -
dJd tS we bfamstormed how m the 
woricl ire we gonna do this? Because we already 
knew we hid these N IH of the hierarchy of PLO. 
Pld versus. 
DCM 1mpress10ns vtfsus Pnsma units? 
So as we go through this. this hierarchy is IS gonna 
be important f« how we do tin. 
So-·re gonna go owr. Len go~ the last 
scen..no first. bl-cause this one IS the the 51mplest. 
And al thlS WIii hetp Aistrate exactly what -
re 
looking ac h«e. 
So with-, NCh of tl'Mtw this IS saying lffl.lgll'lf! 
we're in March of 2024. 
So the the pl1n 111n fhght. 11°s still n.,nrnng. 
It's started on, let's say March 1st and while we're 
1n the month. we know that from Prisma that we 
assigned 54 units to U11s month. 
But wedtdnot assign the 19.000to itbecauffwe 
rf we go blck h«e. you'I SM.

J.<quellMDelron 7A)

Just sect 
Chris. Just real quickly. Do we know for the same 
time penod what months we got PLDDCM and 
pl.an units that \W happen to have gotten? 
Cl,nsfraDff l!Jl 
Within thewK«llnos.yes. that 15,. 
OK. you·re goma get to 11 1n the other tables. OK. 
rorry. Mm hmm. 
Clvi.Fr•~ 8:08 
Yeah. )'f!ah. 
C«rect. I JUSI Wint to go With the most Simplest. 
s .....---o.-. t,, 
Yes. ~.fre wondefful Go fof' rt. 
0,nsFrutin 1:16 
So so the most Slmplest. 
Way of doing 1h11 1s JUSt saying OK. we're not 
going to look at delivery because we don't want 
the numbers to change as we're gomg through the 
throughout the )'*If of or really as we're g01ng 
through the fhght of this ~rt!Clllar. 
Pt.n of th11 Pl(U9e. So in this one rt JUSt trHts 
f!Yfl)'lhing U Wf'/ Sffllply. It's JUSt S.J)'lng 0K. 
What •• the I.WVts by month? 
We kn0'# thlt the total piidage IS 192.000. SO let's 
JUSI t.k• ttw l»f(:filt to whole fof' the month. 
And JUSt 9"19 11 its Wre beuuse the the goal of 
th15 Kenar,o ,s the data doesn·t diange 
throughout the year or throughout the flight. 
And you're gonna see that here. 
So also as an 1llustrat1on of how to read this chart 
as we go through 1t. anything m blue is a future 
month. 
Anything 1n Whtie tS a past month and rl break 
that f\.lle ., a s«ond here~ I did some colOf 
coding on put moot.hi. but you°I see it$ I Scroll 
down r,ow we·r• in Apnt. 
OK.grNt. 
So now~ haYe March and Apnl data. 
Nowwe·re ,n. 
May and you·11 see oothmg changes at all. 
But what we what we wanted to say for this 
part!Clll1r scenano i1 we don't want the data to be 
changing ,n ",ght. but once the year is over~ 
we're now ~ng thtS to be historic& that tS 
WM0 -
WII flip ttw SW!lch and see how rt Kl. 
Deiv«ed bl-cause roly when we were first 
building thd. that wn the srtua110n of the last 
1pmmcyde. 
We were doing this 1n. you Ir.now, December. 
The cyde was what? 
November to November 2023 to 2024. 
So we hid the lu~ury of having all the delivery 
presence to be able to say, OK. this is how 11 all 


~ys out with the hieran:hy of the. you knoW t'lU 
wins Mt. !Mn DCM. then Pn~ 
rm JUsl gonna kNP ~•bog that becau~ Ill 
tmporUnt fOf you guys to !'ffl'lembef that thats 
tMtu.farchy. 
So- had that lux\lry. 
So th1111 gymg the s.ame thing. We don't want 
anything to ch.ange until we·re m the OR past the 
Ipmmcycle. 
So you'll 5ff htre how. 
Say,ng the m.ath M>Urce II Pnsma continues to 
contmun and then Onct! we hit January. that's 
whfflthm91SW1tch. 
Now. rm not gonna exp.am these ignored yet 
becau5e this d 
become this WII become dear 
when I show you another example. but because 
-·rts.aytng 11\11 PU>11theWIOOefin the 
h1er.uchy. and we did tM tnns1hon from the 
prev,ous yur to the New Year, now we·re goon.a. 
look at true !Mhvery, which because there II PLO 
act,v1ty, we·re gonna count up that act,vity 
compared to the overall activity. And then 
Remigrate the spend based on the actual delivery. 
So you11 lff that 1h11 11 mght and day from where 
It w.s fDf a lot of thes-e months. except for the !.st 
_.,,_ 
JacquelneO.-
11oz 
So then quid: qufthon for tM team here befort 
-
fflO'ff on here 'caUH I how confident and Un 11 
mamly a queston fOf T!f-
How confident are you in the team's plan umts for 
2025 versus whtre they were m 2024? 
Thern. P•tti 1128 
Oefillllely more competent 
I wou6dnl s.ay 11'$ 1~ but we're COl1$t.lntly 
asbng thffll to update rt. You know, ~sed off 
what we re IHl"9, 5G. 
It's lfflpr0'111"9, 
G =do°::e,::~ like cause here's_JUst hke 
this. Looking at this. Just only p.1ying attention to 
PLO data. 
Like I think the quMlIon would be though. what rf 
those planned units were nght? 
Right. Becauw then and we were only looking at 
and let's we're tryw,g to do thrs for- ipmm. nght7 
TIMI II the matn ,.as,on. 
KM' this migrated spend. 
And -·re gonna ~ 
looting at data through May 
2025. nght? 
And len can you go ahe~ ;md do the scenano, 
Chris. on the Krffn real quick next to your plal\ 
Unit 1. 
At the No no, M . 
.llicqudine0erJOfl 12:.21 
RJght rwxt to your top K-nos Sc:enano S. Pmtn.l 
only 202,. Dtam~ 202-4. 
ChnJFrarlef 1234 
Mm hmm. 
G :.::~::::t ~:~:~ that the unrts are correct 
but we·re only looking at data through May. 
Solet'ldo. 
let'ss.aythat-tvve. 
ute PLO data fOf those ttve,e ITIOflths. 
Can you put I1,n far those three months? 
I.Jke make somethmg up ind uil twn as. 
Oh here. can I ma~. Oh. 
ChriJFr•iier 13:0II 
Say,ng like this. 
-
~De,yo,,
1 11 
Yeah. UKtly. 
'°"'"' 
My concern • lllw if these planned uruts are 
correct the spend should M. 
19.000 applied to that PLO data. 
Not 1t we·r• loolung It JUSt those PLO months. It's 
gonna 91..,,. that first couple of months.. 
Way too much of the spend, because we'll only 
have pod for those three months. 
And 11'1 going to g1v. 111 of the spend instead of 
the 19,000. 
So thars why planned uorts are so important. 
My next Q\»Shon II Thefnl_ 
How do you th!,. we coukl do tiKe a mass update? 
Your plan uruu and I hke push to 5('l"ll(W le'10fflhlp 
and get tMffl to upch1te fix 2025. 
Do you th1nlt thats feasible? 
TM,'""P•ttl 14:21 
To be honest. th-r're 90nna say that like things are 
already actuahzed and they like some thmgs they 
uin't change. 
-
~0.-
14.29 
kthellwtracter. 
Able to c:oukt -
haw them NI out the liYie 
for all of 2025. 
So that we change the. 
Sorry, Chris. you'r• gonna hate me, 
But instead of looking at what's live using units. 
look at the h..,,. tracker. 


And whilt !hey put down. even fOf the futu~ 
month,o. 
Co,n,1-
N:.f. .and WNt WliS live fOf 2025. 
Thetn.Pa1tj lS: 0 
Well fOf Mure month1i we .are using planned units. 
f) ::~~::1::r:1 ;;:s .acrurate, nght? 
Like at lust tti.y',- tMr~ nght? 
There's no p«ugff w,thout plan uruts. 
0-F,..., 1S-l6 
Thero def1n11.ty pad:.lges without plan units.« 
.. 1 least th«t ~ 
bffn. 
Thetn.PaOI 1S:26 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So so Jackie JUSI want to understand. 
Your mam concern II th.at 'cause we·re pulling th,s 
1n tM mlddt. of 1M )'l!ar. we're going to be 
attnbutang to too mud'! spend ., the begmNng of 
theyea, 
8 ==~=~!Mt.stone. 
So JUst th1t1long ., my Mad. -
have to do two 
different spend's and 1 think we did this idea here 
where 11"1 like 2024. We use the scenano that we 
ltst that we've gone through where it designates 
the spend based off of the higher like. 
Ttwt-n. Patb 1S48 
Mmhmm. 
Ye,h. 
s
J.Kqueli,MO..-ron lWII 
ThewatfflalL 
But then for 20/20. 
5. 
We use planned units so that we don't 
overestimate 11. 
TM,n.,Pattj 1618 
Yeah. 
Yea-h. I think thafs f.a.r 
8 =::::t~
628
scenanos. though. OlOS th.at 
you went through 1 
Beuuse that's where my brain keeps going. 
But Chns did a lot of other ways we can look at 1t. 
So let's ~e whit else7 Yeah. 
Chrlsfradfr 16-.ll 
So thlS so thll Mxt one 15 WNt I thim: you -e 
tryW'lg to get to With With w.antmg me to add thoN 
thfffmonthsdPlD. 
So this II tM Supe, greedy. only loobng at 
histonal CJM"9 al the a edit .. s we ff:"am things. So 
whl'l1 we·re in. So the reHOn why dvs IS red is 
becauw we're ,n tM month the fhght that st.arted. 
but we·re ,n thf! month. 
So the data·s gonna constantly be changing. So I 
JUSt put red to 1ndte1!e that this IS highly volatile 
data. 
When you get ,nto Apf1l that month might still 
""""'· 
There might be l'fltatements .. nd then th!! ameot 
monthshtgl'ityvolillle. 
So thats why I ~ 
this co&or cochng of red and 
yeftow and then once ifs white. rt's like OK. 
It's probably not gonn. h.appen anymore. 
Restatements done to ,l 
So rt's not guaranteed, it's Just 10 indicate that. 
But what th,s 11 doing is this. 
Is this ,s the Super g rffdy 11ers1on where we only 
we only apply bas.ct on delivery data. 
So whit you didn't 5ff 11'1 the prevteus scenano IS 
that we weJe actually getting DCM dewefy. 
Dunng 
ThoL 
That first month. 
We JUSt dldn I end up gettmg PLO delivery. So 
becauw DCM IS in the middle of our h1er.archy, it's 
gonna. If s gonna get the credit but it's gonna get 
all the dollars. 
Then we move on and these are all ignored 
becauw t~re not gonna get any dollars because 
they h.aven·t happened yet. 
Then whl'n we mov-e on to April we got some 
So now they're now. They gotta share the dollars. 
and you·re btiQlly J.ISI keep you~ kHp 
splitting the pod as more people corM wrth their 
wrththelrboWls. 
So. 
It's JUSI gonn, keep going, but wtial's gonna 
happen here 1s because of the hierarchy you'll see 
here. We h111e four months of DCM. Everyth1og·s 
happy. 
Once we fhp to Juty and we get that first delivery 
of PLO. now th.at wtns. as with Its greed and it's 
goma get all the- dollars. 
-===· 
Yeah. So 1U yeah. 
Ch111Frarler 18:32 
And then you know then 11 JUSt keeps playing out 
frnmlh• •'" 


So .rJSt ~SK.ally rt"s ll 
You go back to st.n and then you you jUSt 5J)ktting 
the money ~n based on the greed of mofe 
peopl,e com,ng and asking for. 
Based on thk pod de/lYltfY. 
Now again. with all of these. the encl results when 
Wi' get to the v~ bottom. they"re always gonna 
end up where we wanted Il If we were looking 
h1stoncally and we didn't th1nlc through. you know. 
In flight migrated spend. 
So the last Ipmm cyde we would have seen this 
would be lib. Oh yeah. thats that makes tot.al 
l.Jt~whou,n7 
l.Jte lNS IS wh«(e the PlD delMfy wa:s, I thoughl 
The span Of you know, maybe we care. 
But 1911n. we !Qnoflt lhHe becauw they had thHe. 
They only had OCM dehvery. 
There wu no pod delivery attnbuted for the first 
four months of the flight. 
G =~:-r: N::,, comes to us ~ng 
because nght now our spend that we send to them 
tS dcstnbuted down 10 lhe OCM unpress,ons. 
So. 
G ~=:;;::~::spend 
In months. 31341S161 and then they don't see PLO 
data. and that's when they come to us. Thefesa 
being hlce.

this Is what M 1h15 11 how we currently

So ,n May II whtn we·11 finally get our first look

So 
'NI don't get 11t1.11tl0r'l5 lite the greedy spend.

Owisf,aner 40:11 
All nght. So then looking at the what do we have 
right now? 
The package one 11 pretty straightforward because 
again. we want.a to migrate the dolla~ but we're 
domg 11 prorated based on th@ delivery. 
So what this• gonna h.rle is ,rs gonna give you 
your l)Kk.a9e. This mapped~~• telling 
you 1f....,. Md to mat1Ualy c.oml:llne pacuges ror 
whatewr reason. .,thff a ml$C.0fW'lectlOn rt could 
be t>eauseof the s.pa~te ~ 
has a the 
bilhng hM ,tern, the fffS. What? 
So wt! we mer99(i those two pa<Lllges together so 
that we c.n m1grat• the dollars accurately. 
So 1f we had to manually do that. the this would be 
a yes. but that ,s definitely 1he minority of of these 
packages. We don't. 
Thefe's not a whole ton of them that we've done 
sofa1. 
And then you'I h.rle the data. mooth and data 
,..,. 
And then you, plCU9t: amounts. 
Tlws • gonna be- the same for every month 
beaus. this tf the ~L so do not aggregate 
this column. it IS. 
It 1s the tot.r amount of for the package 1s gomg to 
be migrated. 
And then the. 
The total pllmt:d I.IMS IS JI.ISi mdicalmg how many 
umu there 1r.. because that'll be u~ for 
PfOfatln;. If M
0rt: doing the Units. 
The math IOUKe • there's gonna be a couple 
different~ so yo1.fre gonna see. 
-~ .... 
Pnsma actually let me do thrs m the opposrte. 
Stop. lt's afllkf'. 
So you·re gonna sH PLO DCM. ecom Prisma and 
then unldJJed. And again this is this is the 
hierarchy.

.QO) 
So If II says PW. that muns fl Md PLO del~., 
at one in the hllfarchy. It could have. It could and 
should hlv-e Md DCM. 
lmprHSIOnl and Pnsma untts. but we·re using the 
PLO actMty t,euuse that 1s at the top of the food 
chain. II 11 says unad1usted, 11 means that 11 didn't 
have any of thes• trungs. 
So wt..n we looffd ,n histonc.alty, there was no 
PlOactMty. 
Theft: was no DCM 1mpress,ons. 
And there II no Pnsml units. 
At al for the package 
So this• an •ompte of of ¥When TherMa and I JUSl 
g,d there's lMre's clefin1tely ~e!i wrth Ounrts 
mthem. 
So this one gets the unadjusted. wtnch bas.cally 
says take the dollars 1s pot mto PTisma and JU St 
apply them to those e)(acl same months. which in 
this caH ifs rHlly boring because they just pot the 
same amount basally on every single month. 
~De"•- 4}55

~S~~ng 1n Chns just exactly what 
you have ,n here? 
Could you bnng 1n our MCI 1pmm tactic Nme? Is 
ttat do11ble or @IS)' to do here? 
OnsFr.-

No. nght now doing 11 lnle now. fl I Qn do rt 15

OK. OK. 'cauJt, thllt's what I would need be<:ause 
what we're finding ,s they're llterally selectmg the 
wrong tactte n11me tn placement manager. 
And thllt's whit we bue so much stuff on. nght. 
leHSII? 
Thllts the W'hole mosurement field. 
~Patti 4S:St 
Well.we don't. 
dn:--- -••---• •- · , • .,.. ,._._ 
- ,. __ .. -- ....... 
We use what the plrtl"lel' sends and what the 
package numbt,r 1s to do, like our joins and 
everything. 
Clw11F1arlef 46-06 
Alnght. wtll you're conung upwrth these. hke little 
~ 
tM>C ~t 
Inks hke. let me finish expY1r.ng 
wti..t the alert fOf tnst11nya. 
-
=0.- 4606 
Oh. rm solOfry. 
Yes, go for ,t. 
Chllsf,erlel 46:lS 
AH nght. so. 
Allnght. 
I don t think thefe'11nythlng etse on the~ 
but thrs II so thrs 15 prorating based on the math 
So If we find one lhllt II thei'e -
go. 
So here's a DCM 1. 
So there's OCM delr,,ery. It was only two months. 
But you'll SH here I h1111e these two two CONmns. a 
granular metric and sound metnc. and I JU St call 
them generically metric because ifs determined by 
the math source. 
So tt\lt muns theH •re ,mpresstons. whereas th,s 
prmn one this is umts. 
So you'll SM het'e bK.ause we got one mpremon 
from DCM kw JM'IUMY •nd then the rest of 11 in 
-
All the dolllltl lfe going to fff>ruafy, so R's JJSI 
doing the r11uo Mfe 
So lhal I 90"NI happen. 
Regard depending upon what the math 50urce ,s. 
You do want to SH where 1s active equals one, 
becaus. O<:tt added m hts active logic to this. 


Bu1 that'1 that's what )'O'fre getting at the PK~ 
..... 
lt'spntty. 
1t·1 pretty tM§1h lt-t.t. but 1t1 pn:lf"ating based on 
the m.thSOUl'c. 
And the h~archy so then. 
The nelCI one for plKffllt!nt 
Is now taking the dollars from the padcage by, so 
this this one 1s. 
So thlS 11 buy pKkage by month. 
S~I ,tout months. 
Now ,,v,t"re gonn1 add ,n the p~ement dwnerwon. 
So tt• t1 gom.a be by pKbge by month. 
By-L 
h's 9()rlN evenly sprHd the doll.an fOI'" a~ 
xrou .itof 1U ~ts. but onJy If the 
p~ement WIS actiw Within the month. 
So you an h.ave a J.1tuat1on where. 
A particular plKement was not itctrve 1n. s.o let's 
Just HY that this package was from January to 
December in January, m.1ybe only these two 
pKbgH wt:re lrve. 
March this package became hve, so m January and 
febn.Jary, wt: dorn want to gr;e any of the dolt.rs 
to thtl pacb9e beuuse rt wa:sn t live until MM-ch. 
So that I why ,fl •m~nt to have 1t by. 
By p,,cbge by month .Id then rt checb if the 
placemffl1wasactiw. 
So you·re goon, SM a lot of the same fun stuff this 
now adds ,n the OSP d11ta because the OSP data 
-re not adJust1ng. 
It's not being migrated, it's purely just bemg added 
in verbat,m. for what7 How ,twas delivered so. 
Let's. 
Wher•l"mat. 
-~ 
lt'snolequal 
tsa 
So ~H'\ you·r• l)Otng to see your math souKe. I 
,ust took out the PLT data. 
It's JUSt bemg ~ 
m there. 
And 11'11 be aggreg11ted mtogether at the end. 
But this 1s JUSI to show you 
Know rt's following that same logic. but the math 
sourc• has alrucly bffn determined. 
At the p.ac~ level so this ,s now just urry 
... ,_,~ 
kie. dtd you by chance haw a quesbOn I sad. 
You w11nt to optn it. 
CB o...unp ~ 
49'A~ 
Oh. JUSl one qUffllOn. llke when. 
When I'm gonna l>flng m the OCM data and map 
this m1graled spend data to the DCM data. 
Or should I like refK the final amount? Or do I 
have to like bruk 11 down to the llke for the level 
of the granular111es •s 1n the channel sub channel? 
Of II a alrNcly break II down by at the channel or 
thetKt>Ck-1917 
Owaff&Dl'f S0:01 
If you're JOlnlnQ to the DCM data. 
CB 
CMltanplhM-dwtj 50:11 
Yeah. bt>cause Ilk•. 
ClviJFr•rief S012 
You wanna do 1t to this? 
Yoo wanna do thlS wh@n you want? You don't 
wanna go as f•r down as thrs one beuuse thrs rs. 
Cl a.--,,.....,.._ ,018 
Mm hmm. 
Chm FrUIH S0,19 
This II only currently 
And I'm 90nna ch•ng• ,t. but currently this 1s only 
looking at wh• re ther• ·s PLO activity. 
So tf there was no PLO KtMty, ,rs amently not 
ex1S11ng in ttus view. 
~·re gonna change that and~ the add the non 
PlO dekvefy to tha vteW. but it's gonna haw a lot 
of mlumns that •re nul because of most of the 
cotJmns of this v.M .-e PLO speafic. 
So fof now you·r• gom.a wanna use this one and 
you're gonna wanM use this cotumn CAiied PLC 
final amount 
CS 
CMltan~• BMrdwtj 5(>."8 
EV. 
OK. And so IS I bong hke from the MCA table, 1f t 
bnng m the further level of the granulanties at the 
channel and do II. I don t need to dlStnbute ll 
I canJUSt map ,t s.mpty. What's there 1n thlf final 
~t 
<.dumn7 Tha; piacefflent, final amount 
cotumn. oght7 
Do I get 1t nght7 
OvkFrllllft 51:10 
Wei~ 1f there's multiple,. 
~o.r- 5113 
fo, when you·re doing thlf DCM data. 
G JacqueMneO~ron 51;15 
So m your 1pmm summary report. we want to 


create l. columns. 
Go ~ 
and crute a column wrth using this 
Ubfe l'lffe and bnnging N"I the final amount with 
the us,ng the plaeflMnt pn. 
CII 
o.art.-.p lhwctw11 51 29 
Mm hmm. 
o 
Hcquel1oeDt1ron 51:JO 
And then m another column. 
Do the PLD m19r1ttd speod,o,n and that's? 
Go,ng to ,om wh,;t? At what level? 
ChiJFr&DS
51 ... 
~ 
c:Nlmet, but tMl s the MMM channel. nght? 
-
=~
51,M 
Yeah. M 's trying to pulL merge 1t with the MCI 
So it's all at the placement level, right? So. 
Chr11 F,-
5157 
And you·rt fir,- doing th.IL 
I'm KtlJllly gonn, be doing that but I was goo~ 
do rt here. 
I'm gonN have all those mappings. but it's not 
gonn, Of I ~
·t done hefe m. 
-
=~Deflon SU>] 
So then let's when do you think? I know, Chris. you 
hiJVe so much going on. but when do you thmk 
you were gonna update this to be at the the PLD 
to be plKement level so that Chartanya could only 
an only queey from that one table so rt? 
~epLacement1nd. 
tnduchng the DCM dat.. 
Oinsf,_ lol:31 
This titble has. 
So the final view has. I believe I have the where ,s 
Here 111s. 
So 1t does have the place file amount, so once I 
add those mappings for you. you'll be able to use 
ttm and have the INpping already f<>f you. 
Because nght now I have ~-
So you s.N. as the CNnnet group as I think rt has 
~ 
N"I heft. subchlnnel. all that fun miff 
So I w .. l be d<Wlg thal fOf you when 1t gets done IS 
when Jldoe stops gMng me new miff to do. 
G
J.cq1.1e~oeOt1ron 53:01 
That's so true. I'm so sorry. 
SoOK. 
So m the meantime though Chartanya. 
Query from this both thew different v,ews and JUSl 
show rt nght next to your Views N"I the IP mum 
sumnuty report. So Adam IS columns. 
Cl ~lhwdwMi 5.¼:0 
OhOK.~ect. 
Cool. I wdl start working on 11 and Chns 1n case of 
any ISSUfl. I'll follow up with you. 
Hopefully sounds good. Thanks. 
Ctwisfruler 53:29 
So<H>d,good. 
Yeah. So the only d1ffffence between the file 
amount thlU carry 0V'el' from the pactage and the 
place file amount IS the runber of of~ 
So rm counting the number of placements thlt art 
KIM agatn Within the month and then they cou6d 
alloGlttd accordingly. 
So rf I sort this. 
You get a bad example. 
Here we go. 
So this one. 
Yeah. ·cause you'd be sort of by both. 
There you can SN ,t hefe. 
So you SN how thrtrt"s two placements for? 
For Oc1obef, So they hl'Ye the wme dollar amounL 
CII ~ 
~ 
S,4 19 
OK.OK. Yeah. 
ChoJFraDef 54:19 
But 1f there·s only one, then it then if s Just a 
carryover. 
So then all that happens 1n the next one IS this one 
breaks 11 down ewn further based on the PlD 
But I do rt ,n thrN 1teps because mere·s OM to 
many l'Ntl0f\Sh!p1 fot the for the PlD dat.. 
So yotfre gonna~ again a lot of the same 
repeated ,nfonnahon m here. but when you get 
down to and then. you know. here's all the 
mappmgs rm gonN add once you get down to 
the PLO data. 
When you get 10 this MD channel MV supplier, all 
that fun stuff. 
Then when I do. 
Is I fnt do a cooot of the number of the tKtlC 
NrM plxemenu. so you'll SH here tactlC name 
And then I eYIN)' distobute based on ttwit 
So tf there's mulbP'e, It's goma get dlRnbuted 
thatw'( 
Then I count up the number of. 
Chanr,-ls the MD channel and then I have that 1n 
here as well. 
So channel counts and then 11 gels spht again and 


tMn tM flNI thing I do IS I count the rumbef ol 
MD-
And then agan I havt tJw count and then rt gets 
dlSlnbut«t again and !'Mn so the rumbff you 
-nna uw II the tM fiNI rumbef is cal~ 
distnoot«i~COSL 
So this IS for pod data. 
This 1s th• most granular allocat1on of spend, but 
the way that this 1s different from the way that 11 
was doM before 1s that now we've pivoted out the 
engagement. tr.. rpch and the contact metncs, 
and they'r• all 90nna 9H credrt for the they're all 
90N'll~tlM 
~ 
spend aaou U-.C- numbers. 
So 1n this .-nPM, tMH SO engagements. it's cost 
PERS against this 20. this S2200. !his mas:siw 
amount of read! Mr•. thts 113.000 reachM also 
against that ume amount. 
So when you·re ~lculat1ng your cost per. 
And then I'm 90109 to be adding 1n the DCM 
1mpress1ons and cllcks 1s requested by Himanshu. 
So that'll t>. 1n hue II welt 
So depending on what you're domg. 11 sounds 11g 
~t you really want to use this table with the 
1pmm mappw19S, but you want to use the. 
Wher- II a. wh«-15tlOWed you the~ 
Yeah.No.l"mnoL 
Oh. here rt is. 
You-nN UH thcs column? 
CS 
Ch.rt_,,.1 lhMdwllj 56.-40 
That's correct, yeah. 
ChrkFratler S6A2 
YHh. I lhmk L I and I also h.Jve. 
rm almost posilivt I haw the final amount 1n ~ 
I dorn know why I don t Sff rt. 
Maybe I dropped rt. 
Anyway, Yep, than so thats thats the orly 
difference heft is thlt 11 really. Then ux on all the 
So all this 1s gonna M null 1f there was no PLO 
acl!v,ty. When I get that all Joined together, you'll 
still h.1V11! everythmg up to here. 
~0.- 57<M

This IS basally the SUIM"l.try report Chart.Jnya 
already built. 
YHh. that's what I WilS like rll!lat,ng it to. OK. cool. 
G J.cq~WneOftron 57:17 
Yeah. So what M Jhould do is just use this. 
for us to '"and start queu,ng agamst to Sff 
where -
have spend but no delivery. 
Once CMS updates 11 so when we say 1pmm 
SUfflfflMY rt'P()rt. this IS what we send OYer now 
from an HCP pmpect,Ye. 
And th11 11 what -
can say ilnd we can ultlmatety 
start loolong II th,s data lo give them what they 
~nl, which IS 1f I pull my Pl.D data right now. how

From the PLO data. the DCM data. the Pnsma as

And thl!f1 the In the IQVIA section 1s where a lot of 
the garbage 1s. I don't know what half of these are. I 
think they're aU versions of the publishers 
scorecard. I'm not like I said. I'm not really sure. 
Um. what they are. OOt we'll focus on. yeah. 
8 J.uqvtlineDerron 0;18 
Is this wait quick question? Is this the this is the N2 
version of Oatorarna right? tt·s not the Novartis 
@
M,chari~ llll 
Um. 
~
M,chad~ ll35 
Thank you. I yeah. Thank you. 
G :::ue:::7; ,;:n particular, this is confusing. 
Sorry Gabnelle for the late cal~ but one of the 
things we do want to t hmlc: about in the future r.. 
aligrnng on IQVIA and a O'OU us O'OSS X 
VJSualaatton. So I wanted to make sure you were 
included m this 
u
~helPlot
0:36 
Yes 
G ;hci~= ;: 
..::on of it. While ifs IQVIA. it's 
basically the same data as Cross X. wry, very 
similar. Michael knows the back end better than 
anyone and he's figured it out. the differences 
betwHn Cross X and IQVIA. 
So you're trymg to do a lot of not knowle<Jge 
transfer there and S1art1ng with Novartis because 
we do ~ 
just a lrttle bit of assistance somellmes 
on Nova,rtis too. So Just making sure that across the 
board we are ahgn1ng on these dashboards wti.Jt 
they show. 
And like what each team's role is in rt So this 1s the 
PHM vemon of Data Rama. There's a Novartis 
vernon. _just keep that in mind, So it's taking an the 
data from the Novartis version of Data Rama and 
pip1ng1tm. 
Into the PHM one so that we can show dashboards 
to our internal teams and we also do what we call 
publisher scorecards. So what Michael you're 
saying is we have a bunch of stuff in here that we 
don"t know what It IS. 
a M,chad Klemrrn. 2.-0S 
Yeah, I mean. looks hke DIDH tnecl to do oor 
scorecard This one was when Ankh, I think had 
different. 
f) Ju'luelinrl>ffron Z:15 
Scorecards. 
~ 
M,chad Klemrrn. Z:16 
Scorecard. So I'm just gonna hide that one. Um. 
I think this IS the mapping file. Might have been a 
DaVld creation to be honest. I don't remembef" this 
one in 1t. Sure. 
-
J.lc'luelinrDerron 2:32 
Can you do me a favor? Can you wort with Sean to 
figure out which of these are? Well also which one 
of these are going to their a,ctual d~hboards on 
Teams nght now? 
~
M,chae!IC~s
Z:44 
It should be the partner scorecard stats Sig and

Yeah. it's 1n this section. this first section here. 
G
J.cquelioeDerron 1~ 
OK. so then every month they should review the

year to date. 
Methodology.

Metncs Who can wnte up the methodology? Cause 
l know you told me rt's comphcated. 
ClvlJF,_ 16:32 
No, it's not comphcated. Jt's Just it's just 
representmg the CTO values in the raw data. 
So IQV Just gives us the numbers. We don't do any 
calculation. 
G J.cq...,l1oe Dffron 16:AS 
OK. 
~F,_ 16A6 
We used to. That's v.t.at I asked you earlier befOJe 
about Um. 
There used to be a complete calculation that 
summed up the target reach by month and the 
quarter and then divide them into each other, 
create a ratio and 11 was only affecting Kesimta, 
f) JKquelioeD'1ron 17:08 
Oh, oh.••••. No. OK. thafs because we only recewe 
quarteffy data for those brands. It's that one data 
cut but that you had sent me. But like. we still only 
get quarterty, nght Michael? 
ChrisFr.tDel" 17;27 
No. 1t"s 1t was for Kesunpta as well. which we get 
monthly. 
G
JKquelloeD'1ron 17:31

18,45 
The Kisqali and thffl there was a similar calc\llation 
done for S,mbloex 11nd fOJ Ptivicto. 
@ hcquelineOenon 18.52 
OK. but Michael you probably built those

@ Mict>M,I Klemen$ 18:55 
Yeah 
I did not be. I gave him time. 
@
~Klemens
l 9:06 
Yeah. So for the quaneffy d ients, the year to date. 
IQVIA doesn't do year to date, they only do the 
quaner to date and and monthly period types. So 
Bl talked with IQVIA and that's what they came up 
with. 
And how to worlc around no year to date calculated 
values for those those brands. 


~D«,on !W 
So. 
OK. So Chns. I think I ~ 
the channel itself got 
cut. but -
1dl onty get quMteriy data for our 
oncology.

do that year to date methodology to be able to get

Like how the data's presenting itself and then. 
QA ING It. So when yoo log in. this IS what tM 
page like looks like when yoo come in here. To be 
honest with you. I don't use like anything ove, 
he,e. 
The only thing that I do is I come to create and 
we're always gonna use the SQL worksheet.

That we're 1ngestmg mto snowflakes. so. 
So these are some of the tables that Novartis has

And this has to happen a lot with lik• data that 
we're not getting on our stde that~ rely on 
Novartis to send us.

Oh. mce. 
So hke.. ~ 
me c1o that ,1nd then add the double 
slamH bKt 10th.JI II hke really a coo( fHture. 
lt saves a lot of time 
So I've been d01ng that quite frequently. 
But yHh. so basically these. this Is what you're 
gonna run. 
And then if 1f you chck on 11. 
It's gonna bring up all the columns that elOsl In. 
The t,1ble 1n thlt Vlf'W, 
We don't atways need an the columns. so like. 
You= 
Kind of pd: through whit you need the most. 
It's typaly hkll!'. you know. adYeruser to.~ 
name. you know the typie.11 soft umpaign narM. 
c.ampaign 10. 
lmpress,ons. dlCks spend ltke lh,091 !Ike that so 
that you don't hr.I. to run ~hing 11II tht- t1m•. 
It becomes hke rt. 
lfl take a while if you start trying to run 1111 the 
columns. but you could do this so if thl'rll!'·s ttvH 
dots next to the n&me and it·s gonna g,ve you the 
opl!On to pi,,ce the MrM m the ed•tor. 
So that you an run the query you ur,. 
They11 gwe you the option to copy the name and 
then you an actu.ly you can Add al the columns 
mto the editor and then delete as needed wt"ch 
helps 'cause like not d. Not an the columns. 
And this ,s the thing thait annoys me the most 
about. 
These 111ews Is that different people set them up. 
so I111:e thmgs th111 would be standard hke 
Impress,ons. T~t SffmS hke a standard n• m•, 
nght? 
Doflnl alw.JYS 511Y lffl~S10ns. 
SometimH ,t A)'S Imp,. 
Sometimes II says lfflP,ffSOM With mpress,on. 
Ith so It s good to hke be able to copy tlwm or 
.Jdd them mto the editor so you know that. OK. 
these arll!' euctly the~ rt's listed io this table. 
So hke 1f I dick that. 
It's gonna clo. It's gonna add htm exactly the wr, 
you need them. and then }'OU could JUSt delete IS 
you.-
llache4Plot 1,:02 
The ottwr thing. and we could get a little bit mor. 
mto this and I'd hke 1h11 part a lot. but sometimes I 
need to find out. 
Whal the sources of these tables are, sometimes 
these TA tables are missing things that we need. 
AM vnu n-,t In h.lN"lrtr111"li: tn lt!f.- wh11t hrnl.1,; th,,. 


table. 
I use the View defimt10n to backtr.tek. so 1f you M 
view defimt1on 11 bnngs up exactly what it's hke 
puning in and then 11'1 show you what It"s 
refereoang. 
So like I can see here that it's bnng1ng all this 
informat10n m from that INT table. 
Then I can look at the. I can then go ahead and 
dick on th.at I NT ta~ VtPN defir11t10n and I hen 
trace thal table back and I could see d hke 1hIngs 
are milling like I could see 1f they forgot to add 
one of the metncs I. 
Or we're not pulling m one of the metnc:s. I can see 
rf if there's an aggregate table of ltke alt the social 
partners, did they forget 10 put a partner In there? 
So like. that's a really cool feature because it's like 
it's like easy code reading, you know.

() ::;,: 
oi'::~ and then I do from. 
You're gonna wanna pvt the table that you're

could just place the name m the editor. 
You could hteralty run thlSJUStJUSt as th,s hke .

Show everything I mean. Well m this case you 
could probably Just do like select asterisks, nght? 
u
~he!Piot15:52

easy beuuse like I guess that you could JU St delete

•• Andrew Ry•n 16,ll 
I'm going through these pretty easy, but no when I 
get to the a real huge data set. 
I think. Oh my God. What lhe hell do I put here? 
Bui this 1s nice that 11 hke kmd of can populate 
some things for you. 
u
~~Piot 16:21 
lk.now. 
Exactly.Exactly. 
And we have a few like. there·s a few different ones 
that you'll use most frequently, and great news 1s. 
is that aa we haw some example sequel hke codes 
that we use frequently for, like the OMA 
companson and that UL the DMA and natlOf\al 
data to EU. 
Companson. There's a whole file unbox t~t JUSI 
has nothing but example codes for each table. 
Or each view. but you could atways bke manipulate 
one of those. 
You know too. 
And I couk:I show you some of the ones that we 
use the most frequently, but hke I still can't wnte 
like I still have trouble with wntIng. 
Like more complex ones. I still have trouble with 
joins like JOimng to our like dass1f1<:at1on table, but 
great uses is that you have people on the team 
that can help you with that. 
So like Chatanya can help with that. 
He's really great at creating quenes. 
Kyle. 
Knows that Chr~ Thomas. you have • bunch of 
people you could be bke. Hey, I'm struggling with 
this query. Can you help me out? And 1hey'll 1hey'II 
help you build one out and then greal news ,s you 
can save 11 and then marupulate It as you need It. 
So but yeah. so this ,s pretty much rt 
And then what? 
I typically you could save like you can gel the three 
dots up here. 
You can rename your sheet. 
You can rename 11 by cl1<:k.Jng m 1t. You could 
delete the sheet ,f you no longer need tt. 
But 1f I were to run something. 
So let me show you really quick. 
Let's go back. 
I'm gonna delete that one. 
I'm gonna pull up. 
Let's just run this be this middle query right here.

But as always. you don't come into the definition 
and start trymg to change stuff. 
You're good. 
Like if you're domg stuff in the worksheet, you're 
fine .

._ And,_ ~n 2U6 
To avoid defirnbons 'c.ause 11 would]Ust love to uy 
out some of the SQL stuff I'm trying to leam on 
like real data sets. but without ru1r11ng everything. 
o
:;Piot22:28 
Yeah. absolutely. 
And hke I said. you can come here and use hke. 
Agam you can come through that. 
The like data enablement thing that where that we 
have you c.Jn start lookmg at these different tables 
and running queries. 
There's a like a box link. 
Umm. 
This box link. 
Has a bunch of queries that you can llke, save or 
test out to or manipulate as you need. 
I thmk some of the ones that and I can Just type 
thrs in here, but some of the ones I hke to be 
cognizant about. I guess IS no, I was hoping I could 
just wnte in thefe. 
some of the ones that we use the most. 
That I think ,1re ,mportant that you know, let's JUSt 
write in Excel 
So after you do like sele<:t and you put your e1thef 
select from or you do your your different ltke 
columns that you want to bring 1n. You're gonna 
wanna do where. 
ls active. 
Equals one. 
So we use a zero and one d1fferentli1tor m. 
In Snowflake to determme bke an actrve line item. 
For the table so that way like 1f there's any 
historical stuff or things that were like like like 1f we 
had. you know, old stuff to an old t1ke a placement 
that is no longer valid, it doesn't hke duplicate and 
like . 
._ And,_Rpn 2419 
0~ 
numbers and things like that. 
So where is active equals one IS supposed to gr.1e 
you like the cleanest data set of what )'OU're 
supposed to be expect1ng 1n terms of delrvery. 
Another one 1s that l use a lot 1s date ranges. 
So, especially tf we're doing a backfill for like a 
Facebook campaign. 
t would want to do ltke select from or the different 
things from the Facebook table. 
Where, say we had a backfill for April. So I wanna 
do where you could do. 
l.Jke if we're stJII m Apnl, you could do greater than 
equal to and our date. 
Set up hke you're gonna wanna do. like. 
A hke a. Oh. my God. Why can't I come with the 
name ofth1s right now? 
Quote No. oot a quote. 
What i$ that? 
Whatever that is, the one. Thank you.

at 11 and went. 
You forget what? 
That is. it's always the year and then a dash the 
month and then the day. 
So if you're still m April. you can use where greater 
than equal to. If you're in May, and you want to 
Just see.

then I'll be like, OK. 
We're missing this column. 
We're missing th,s column. 
We need to bring these m. 
And then I did the same thmg wh«♦ we had a 
couple new fiekb In the crHtlll♦ taxonomy

And then I had some fNdbad: fof' them.

I went and QA. 
We had our OMA tabl• looked KCUrate compared

R.KhelPlot1t1rtflltr..sc1ipt,on 
u :
.~:a:~~: a btrte bit about Novartis data 
Rama 
So bas1ulfy what 1s occumng? What we're as vre 
ment10ned yesterday, Snowflake Is k.Jnd of the 
warehouse. 
Ifs the warehouse. It's cen1ral. 
Ifs hub for all the data. 
So once it's in Snowflake. we send It lo thi5 
datarama. 
X 
This datarama Is owned by the d1ent ~ke so. Ag.am, 
you'll see Salesforce m the m the right hand stde 
you'll see the big Novartis logo on the left hand 
L like I said before. I typ,ca1fy. 
Keep lhe the dataramas m separate browsers Just 
so I can distinguish what Is what. If t'm moving fas1. 
So with this one we do not set up 
The actual dashboards In hen~ we don't do 
anything In the visualize tab. 
So hke all of these thmgs that you see on 1he Side 
here CXJtslde of like N2:. QA is like set up by the 
NovarttS analyst that they·ve hired to to set it up. 
So they handle all this. I I to be honest with you. I'd 
never look a1 anythmg in ttus tab. So typically for 
this data Rama. I'm gonna analyze and act and 
connecting conned index. 
So once yotJ get your 52:1 access like yotJr e-mail. 
Your access to. 
This your access to thts dataama will happen and 
then you·u use your like your your Novartis e-mail 
to log mto 1t. When you do get the access. lei me 
know because you should 
•u•. They're gonna tell you that you have to acc-ess 
this through. 
Through the Citrnc PortaL which you don't have to 
do. you could JU5t 1ond of reset your password and 
then you'll be able to use it on your own 
computer. 
So like when you get the llC1;tiS. we can talk more 
.about1tlfit's like. 
lfit comes through like weird. 
let's let's talk about connected next. 
So connected mix 1s b.asically like what I consider 
the back end of datarama. 
So this is where alt of like the engineenng and alt 
of the data enablement stuff happens. So 
We use a few different things In th,s. 
In this menu we use data streams. We use 
dimens10115 and we use measurements. 
So it's not about the the data streams first. 
So this is If you go to datastream hst th1s is gomg 
to house an of the data streams that we have set 
up that are that have 1hat aJe coming mto. 
Data Rama is everything coming mas you can see 
there Is a lot in here and not all of Jt IS ours. 
So that Is hke important to note Is that like some 
of these are like consultant agencies. 
They hired some of them are their offshore teams. 
So we. came in and then I love doing stuff because 
then they end up copying us. But we labeled all of 
our data !itreams that we h~ set up with N2. s.o 
we can actually tell wh1di ones are ou~. 
So this kind or looks very similar to like what we 
were talk.Ing about like the other day. 
So hke we have like. 
The hke. 
The the PCM snowflake table. 
Get ingested mto this d ata stream and dehvers 
data that way. 
We have the same thing f« hke SA 360. 
We have stuff f Of Snapchat and you'N see that 
there·s a few different kinds of like. there's a few 
different tables with SJmdar names. 
I don't wan1 to talk about Pnsma. 
So hke we have two for B of It. One is the actual 
delivery table and one ,s a class1ficat1on table. 
So this is like our. 
Table In whKh like. 
We're ,ngestmg the classifications that we've. 
That we've set up where we're hke kinda union and 
JOtmng everything. 
To be honest I don't check the classification tables 
that often. 
I am typically if th.re is an mue. I'm typlcally 
lookmginthe. 
Delivery tables. 
Umm. 
The reas.on for thal is because we do classifications 
mhere. 
So this is kmd of just adding addrtIcmal la}'fls of 
that classifi.cat1on. 
And then there's other Wil'fS lo check. like 1f there's 
classification errors which won·t go over welL go 
But what I'll typ1calty do like ,f you come mto If you 
click on the data stream. you"II see a bunch of 
options at the top. 
CJ 
I::: 


Edit Is Just gonna show you. 
Exactly where, where the data's coming from? 
So if I Scroll down. 
You'll see the query t hat's running from Snowflake 
to pull in data so you can see that this one is 
pulling data from another delivery where the date 
ts greater than 2022. 
And t hen the date is. 
Greater t han equal lo the current date, -90 oh. 
Wait this is exed out? That was out. 
So sorry this one the 20221 is no longer valid, so 
it's actually JUSI pulling current date minus. 
90days. 
So this 1s important because if we have an innovid 
like say we have an innovid delivery issue. 
For December. 
And December 2024 and we fix It with like whet her 
we had to do a backfill with like redshift or t here 
was just like a connectivity issue or t here was just 
like some sort of issue w ith the data in stowflake 
we will have to talk with engine. 
I typically 
You probably saw me the other the other day. 
Asked about Reddit. 
We just have to have and I typically don't do this 
because I'm just worried about u••••• up the data 
stream so bad. to be frank. 
So I typically would just be like can we run do a 
one t ime run of this? 
Longer than 90 days to get an issue resolved. 
Thal happened in December because right now it's 
only pulling data from Snowflake back 90 days. 
So in order to get the December data. they'll do a 
one time extension to get data for t hat December 
t ime frame and t hen they'll fix it and I'll bring it 
back to the 90 days. 
And that's the reason why we have this set up is 
just 'cause. There's so much data. 
And there's so much. 
There's so many datas, there's so many data 
streams that MCM Cl is not scalable. 
So you can't make it faster, which socks. 
Like unlike how we have the different warehouse 
runs in Snowflake and we can be like, oh, this is 
going to take 1S minutes. let's do an extra large 
warehouse run so that it only takes a few seconds. 
Like we can't do t hat in in data Rama. 
So In order to keep things as speedy as possible, 
we try to sometimes limit date the date ranges on 
larger datasets. if that makes sense. 
So yeah, so this IS. 
I'll typically kJok in here to see like where where if 
I'm like OK. looking at a data stream issue, I'll 
typically see like look at where we're pulling from 
for Snowflake, I'll see. Like what? 
The date range is for it. 
We're pulling in that is active flag, so making sure 
it's only the valid active data datasets to avoid 
duplication and theo. 
It's all I typically look for t here and then if you 
Like. 
A couple other things. Like you know. you can see 
t his is a successful. The last time t ran it it's been 
successful. It's enabled. 
So that means it's running like it's running like 
almost all the time. I t hink it's actually running like 
every two hours from Snowflake. 
And t hen if you come to exe<:ution history. you'll 
just see all the successful runs. 
So you can. 
It doesn't always sort. 
It kind of sort weird sometimes and it I hate that it 
does this because if some stuff failed in the past. 
It'll show first ·cause there's a new start date, but if 
you JUSI come down you'll see like OK. 
This ran on M ay 8th. 
You could do. 
Oh yeah. you could do start execut ion date. 
There we go. 
But yeah, you can see that the last time it ran this 
file ran, it was successful. 
So everything came through as as planned. 
If it's not successful. 
So sometimes you'll see that the run status might 
show as successful. Sometimes it'll show as invalid. 
If it's invalid. there's a problem. 
Sometimes this will show a successful and some 
stuff failed. 
So I will again to make sure the wrong status 
within the indtvidual file and start execution time 
was successful. If we're seeing issues. 
And t hen lastly. like you could or the last two 
things t hat we really look at here are mapping and 
pivot table. 
Let me go to the pivot table first. 
So pivot table will just quickly pivot out t he data 
that you could find in t he data stream. 
So this 1s that data st ream. 
That I'm looking at. That's like filtered here and 
t hen it brings in a few ro~ but then you could 
bring in like ot her stuff like campargn ID's, 
advertiser ID's. The only thmg you're not gonna be 
able to bring ,n if you're Just looking at the that. 
Singular data stream is our classification, so if 
you're look.mg for somet hing that says like. this i-s 
kisqal1 MB C DTC. 
That field is not going to populate like our our 
brand report name 
Games and stuff will not populate if you're j ust 
looking al this data st ream, because that's not 
located in the data stream that's located in the 
classif1eat1on streams. 
So you won't see that if you're j ust looking here. 


And yeah, if you could just we'll go over the pivots 
and analyze an act but very, very simple. 
The only thing thafs a little difficult is Just getting 
the hang of what we name stuff that took me a 
long time, because I refer to something, 111 if rm 
looking for something, 
I'm typically like going to look like from deep, like 
from just being on media tech. 
I'm going to be like, oh, I need to find a campaign 
name and not everything is named campaign 
name. Sometimes, like, you have to look at an 
advertiser level. 
So sometimes it's like campaign advertiser. 
We don't call things campaign names or place 
We don't things placement names in here. 
They're called media by name. 
The media by key is the like Prisma ID that used to 
be. 
lnd uded all t he placements so it just takes a little 
bit of use to get like familiar and comfortable with 
like. 
These like kind of catch all names that we use for 
all channels versus just thinking of like what we've 
been seeing from like adcm perspective 
So let me go back. 
And then the last thing on the stream is the 
mapping. 
So when we get t he data from Snowflake, ifs just 
all those singular columns. right? 
Like we run if you do the select from, you"ll see all 
the columns that are in that in that table 
So if you do mapping, you"re gonna see. 
What we mapped from the from the delivery from 
Snowflake, so those columns from Snowflake what 
we mapped to in and into datarama and what the 
name is for those columns. 
So we don't use the exact exact name from 
Snowflake columns. 
We aggregated to other names. 
So as you can see like I was saymg placement ID, 
we don't call it a placement ID. In MCI we call it a 
media buy source tag. 
A video name is in. 
It's stowflake 1s a creative name in MCI, so 1f you're 
ever just llke I have no idea what to call this certain 
d1mens1on, you can always come to the mapping 
and see exactly what you have to have to look for. 
You can see at the top we have a bunch of stuff 
t hat's unmapped from Soowflake. and that's just 
because like we don't need it for. It's kind of just 
like we don't need it right now for innovid like 
lnnovid. 
On Novartis, we've used three ad servers we've 
used DCM. We've used moov1d and we've used 
flash talk.mg while we use innovative flash talking 
just like anything else we do at PHM. DCM IS t he 
source of truth. 
So like we try to tie everything back usmg only a 
few different fields, because honestly, we·re not 
realty concerned about the intimate impressions. 
Like we yes, we want to see. 
End of impressions 
We want to make sure that like those teams should 
be making sure that innovid impreS5ions look very 
similar to DCM impressions. To make sure there's 
no tagging issues. but from like an overall metnc. 
See nano the only thing. 
Thal we care about from from lnnovid is video 
completion rates. 
Because everything else should be DCM like. we 
should just be looking al DCM for the source of 
truth. 
But because we're not running the video in DCM. 
we don't have those video completion metrics. 
So yeah. So like you'll see at the top. all the things 
that we haven't mapped that might be in the 
columns of snowflake. 
And then you'll see all the unwrapped data fields 
from MCI that like you could map them to if you 
wanted to. 
So if for some reason we decided tomorrow that 
hey. we actually have to bring in the campaign ID 
for innovid we could take this and map it to say 
like campaign ID. 
Oo. 
Or like campaign key on this side on this side and 
we would we would clearly talk about that and 
determine what is the best data model field set up 
in order to handle th~ unmapped case. 
To be honest with you, I haven"t had to map 
anything since starting, but it's something that 
we'll probably have to do a little bit mo re often if 
we get like new data streams and w hatnot. 
So like. 1 feel like Kyle and I have been getting kind 
of used to this recently. but. 
We haven't had to like, realty do anything to date. 
Kyle is working on a project for GSK to get like 
Datarama set up. So he's getting a lillle bit more 
into t he weeds with this 
So we'll kind of lean on him to maybe make some 
like best practice documentation so that if we do 
have to set up something new on Novartis. we 
have something to go off of. 
OK 
So just going to discard that. 
But yeah, so again, all of our data streamsto, I'm 
only really using these to see what the, what ifs 
referencing for Snowflake, what what tables we·re 
using for Snowflake. I'm using it lo see like if there 
if we're having data iS5ues. 
Does it? Does the? Does the data stream have like 
a certain date range? 
Could the certain date range? 
Be impacting it. 
Did we maybe update the table al'ld stuff like 
recently and then forget to update the the table in 
thp O!IPrv hPrP to rp flf'rt thp nPWP~I t:1hlP?

C3otyou.o«.cool 
RKWPIOI 1~1 
Soyw,1h. cool 
otC. 
So ttm was l)l"etty much all we do m the datl 
Another thing thlt I like to use I lot Is this d1t1 
So sometImH I'm like like I'm look.mg at 
something In MCt and I'm hlce. I h.Jve no 1du 
where this is pull,ng from. 
And I do not want to look ttvough every Single 
datl strum to fi9ure out where thts ~ pulng 
from. tit., whit IS ~ 
to tt.s.. 
So if thd ~ 
this IS the one problem about It IS 
th.it som.tmes this takfi for-t'Yel'"to lo.Id. but one. 
You un search for an MCI d1mens.ion. 
Or metnc and 11 will then show you a visllilli2a110n 
mapping to each data stream. 
That Is. !hit data Is gemng pulled from into that 
metnc. I find this extremety helpful because 
s.ometImH I'm ~ke I don't remember-what this I 
dont remember whit this encompasses. 
I don't rttnemberwhat ~ 
we·re getting datl 
for thd and then tM w,I ,-m show me real qudly 
wtlillt data streams apply 10 this metric 0< this 
I'm gonna let thts load In the background. 
But y.ah. I In data streams I'm typic.ally only nght 
now using data streamhst and data mapping 
visualizer. 
Do I thtnk we UH dltl mappmg al all? 
It's kind of the same thtng as the visualller, but I 
findtheVISUlkzff. 
W1y fflOfe htt4pful when It ~ 
and honHtty 
SC>nW I didn't think tN5 tlvough. but s.ome strHms 
might be running nght now sk>Wlng down. 
This ICCOUOI 1111821' us«!.. 
All nght So lei's talk about dImenSK1ns and and 
measurements. 
So in these bstl you'll see hke where you can see 
hke a d1mens10n 11st 
Calculate d1m~StOOS and hierarchie5 are typlulty 
the things that I use the most 
let's look II the d,meos,on lrst 
So thlsjUSl 9Nfl you lotmily .a kst.of all the 
d1mensaons thlt ,.,. that are M-1 up and thew 
d1mens100S are not 
Like manipul.atl'd in any w.ay 1s what I should say 
hke. 
So it's like 1f you search. 
Ohwa1t. 
Like I'm uyIng to think of a metric that we don't. 
OK.pHfect. 
So like ump119n ~n1~r bke at the end of the 
day. tM campatQn adwrt,s.er ,s the campaign 
.......... 
W.:'re not rnanlJIDy manipulating anytt.,g to Mwt 
It dfot«m1nt 1111 campaign .advemser. 
Oh.here we go. 
let's go bKtc to daUI VISUIIILllK>n really quick. 
So y..ah. thn. 1s the mapping visualizer to say 1f I 
wanted to see likt whitt? 
Where i1re we getting media cost from? 
lsab19isttM9one. 
Like this IS one I thmk t have to look up al the tlfM 
beuuse like Costco Is from different platfOffflS.. If 
youd!d:onthis.. 
Andup,ndll 
lfl tell you ~ 
s.ngle data stream that feeds 
rnMiaCOSll'ltheflMCL 
So ~·re getting cost from Google ads You Tube. 
we're getllng like .and whit what those different? 
It'll .also show you what that Is c.alled In each 
Before you map It to MCI. 
Like Meta. ,l's pulhng from meta. 
Ifs pulling the $pend from meta. 
It's pulling the spend COUl'ln from ntaot. 
It's pulling lf)fflt from Lri:ed.ln. 
Wt'rf do tt.y all II spenL 
Thiiltssow«rd. 
It like you will SN hke plan them out 
We're 9011"19 to pl.an them out from Prisma. that Is 
10 determine DCM. 
We're pulling cost from FA 360, so it'll show. 
Show )'OU exactly. 
Where that is com,ng from and what datl strHm. 
So I low lhcs V1W1lt2er beuuse ike I get confused 
hke npeotly"W•th like. rm not realy. 
u =~t::,k:.~t: not fam1liarw1th prmt 
Where Is this commg from? 
So hke this IS rully tt.lpful. 
And thafs IN ,t does. 
And hke you can Just dck 11 and then sometimes 
l'I highlight stuff 0< I copy the names and pbot It 
mthat 
In that prvot tJbM ltke- filter for one of thes.e. 
Data sttums., order to s.ee like an issue. so It 
doesn't have to look through .all the different d.at.t 
streams to find what I'm asking It for. 
Cool. So yeah, this IS this IS really helpful 
0~ 
So y.ah this. 


I don't k:now what happ@ned here. 
Yeah. So these are all ,ust the like, these are all hke 
what I lrlce to can static hlce d1menS10ns. 
So this 1s Just what like I could pay an advertiser as 
a campaign advertiser. This IS this llke we're not 
manipul.itlng any. 
Thmg to mto a budc:et of sorts. 
let"s JUSI put rt that w.ry. 
So the cam~n name IS campaign name. 
Campaign start date is campaign start date. 
Calculated dimensions 1s what we woric 1n the most 
and what I have time set up on the calendar 10 
start tallong to you about next week. 
This is lcmd of like the nght now the bread and 
butter of us trymg to dasslfy data. 
So and this gets lilce 11 does get very confusing. 
So I'm not going to go through too many things 
today, but. 
let"s k>ok at 
OK. brand report name so and we might have to 
I"m actually loolong at this now and 1·m not1e1ng 
that these other teams are com,ng m and adding 
stuff. 
I might have to come ,n here and Ktually add N 2 
before all of ourt. because this 1s gonna get very 
confusmg unle5S you're familiar with like all of our 
fields. 
So I"ll do the ume thing that we dtd fOf the data 
streams and the calculated d1mens10ns because 
some of these. like this ones not not ourt. they 
bastcally JOSI hke copy what we dtd. 
To see when I do .

Rac~Piot2S:S4 
I get 1t. 
•• Andrew Ryan 25:5'1 
I ~ 
to know what I'm loolongfot". 
CJ =~~,:~understand. 
So yeah. so brand report name. So I think I 
mentioned rt before that we have. 
We have technically. 
3 v,ews of like S1m1lar to how we have hke the 1n 
Snowflake, we have hke the STG. we have lhe IOI 
and we have the bio. 
We have similar. 
We have a similar setup with class,ficahons. so we 
have and I'm. Sometimes you'll see qa, honestly 
don't know why they dtd AOA 1n Dev here. 
Historically that does not make any sense to me. 
But that we use Dev. 
We use the regular named one with. 
Nothmg m front of ,t. 
And then we use RI. So thmk of 11 this way. 
That is where we work in to test ,tout and see 1f 1t 
works and see make sure ,t doesn't break anything 
else. 
If everything looks good and everything looks 
right we push 11 to what the? 
Just the regular name. Th,s is considered IM. 
Once ifs live, Novartis can see 1t 
Novartis can see, like all the updatH that we mffl 
and then RI is our re1mmers10n. 
And so lhlS IS the thing that takes the loop bade 
into Snowflake and 11 geu readJusted ,nto MCI and 
all th,s is a flat file. 
II Just helps to speed up usage. 
So. like Rt 1s d we're ta I long with people at Nova ms 
or we"re running reports on our end or doing 
ptVots on our end. I try to use the RI because again 
ifs a plat file and it's go,ng to rvn really fast 
Asked. 
And that's all. It's basically used for. 
So we're bai.1cally operating m Dev RI and then the 
regular named one. 
I'm we're l'm trying to set up a the right now and 
this 1s the thmg that I was talking to you about and 
we'll kmd of get mto this a little bit more about hke 
trying to set up AQA. and data Bnx. 
We have a report and I'll show 11 to you after where 
we pull th~e like we basically pYII. 
Right now we're JUSI pulling m Dev and the regular 
name, and if we make an update ,n Dev. 
We pull a report that a hlJ9e report that shows all 
the death fields and all the regular field and we 
check to see ~ke 1f anything that we made m Dev 
negatrvely impact anything fOf any other columns 
before we push rt live. 
It's hke a w.,, to check that the code that we made 
here. 
~n't mess with anything else. 
What we're trymg lo do IS.. 
There there. there's a better w.ry to QA. this hke on 
a daily basis. And we're gonna try to figure out a 
way to feed the class,ficabon. like report that we're 
doing this informahon in and have 11 post oh, this 
this line and Rhode Island have 1t pull m. 
The data bncks and then have data bricks run JUSt 
a true false on 11. 


board. 
So that way we can kmd of catch any erro,s befo,e 
like we try to do a QA for the week because this 
takes a lot of time to do. 
And Kyle? 
Kyle has been patiently doing It. but ,rs not 
perlect. 
So like. I think ,f we can gel something manual or 
automated go,ng and data bricks. ,fll kmd of Just 
provide us a safety net In case somethmg goes 
wrong. 
But we had somethmg happen recently where hke 
we were queuing dev and thrs and for some 
And people were l~hng us that the RI was wrong 
and there was some kmd of hlCCUp m Snowflake 
side of It. readJust1ng the hke Re1mmers1on field. 
And we had no idea because we haven't been 
looking at this. 
We -
·re we're only lookmg at these two. 
So now we're gonna look at all three. 
But let me show you really qu1ek hke this Is what I 
was talkmg about with like the kmd of SOL MCI, 
SQL based stuff. 
And again, we·n go through this more m depth. 
but like this Is where we work m tt11S Is where we 
make updates. 
And then if the updates look good m here. then I'll 
have Kyle b.Js1cally copy. And when I s.ay push it. I 
bas1Ully have him copy and paste 11 mto rnto the 
regular. 
The regular field and then once II does that. that 
reprocessing and the snowflake the update t~t -
made hef-e wrll show here. 
Does that make sense to some degree? 
.. Andriew RyMI »,43 
For the most part. 
o
~PM>t »M 
Yeah. And we·tI, we·11 go through classrfications way 
more in depth. 
We're gonna do like 3. Like a base of hke a three 
parter on it 
'.\ Andrew Ryan 3°'51 
Mm hmm. 
0 .::7'her:~~t a lot of mformat,on here. but 
we we work agam mostly In here m d1mens1ons. If I 
need to find other dimensions that are In use. rll 
sometimes look here. but for the most p,an ,-ist 
calculate d1mermons. 
.. Andrew Ryan 30S4 
Yeah. 
(.) =
•:g:: 
d1mens10ns. 
Ifs the s.ame exact thmg, except tfs JUSt 
So you can find like the ImpressIon stuff the like 
conversion. all of that mformabon here revenue. 
And then calculate measurements we don't have 
as many four. There's not as many things that we 
need to do here. 
So it's mostly where we're operating in, ,n 
dimensions. so. 
So this is pretty much the ovel'V!ew of the 
connectomex. Aga,n. we·re only touching a few 
fields in here. 
Let's go to analyze ilnd act and talk ii little bit more 
about reporting. OK. so. 
Baskillly. 
Ooce.OK. 
So Ada fTom Snowflake goes to Novattis data 
We do all of our daSS1ficat10ns m data Rama. We 
like mampulate data. standarchze everything. 
Those dassrficat10ns get readJUSted mto Snowflake 
as well 
Data comes back m. 
Classified m that re 1mmers,on. 
Process. So now we have. 
Let'sth1nkof it. 
OK. that it's run this full process dass1fiecl re 
immersion data is back m Novan1s. MCI. 
How do we get that data ,nto back into Novartis at 
the end 2 MCI. 
So what we do ts. 
We actually JUSt have. 
Reporting expons out. 
So we're JU St bas,cally exporting the the 
REIMMERSION dilta. 
From our NBS MCI back mto N2. MCI and so when 
you when we talk. about N2 MCI tomorrow. 
These exports come mto N2. MCI as a data stream. 
So N2 data stream Is fed by N2 exportS. 
NBS data streams ilre fed by Snowf\ake. 
Umm. 
We typically don't update anything on upons. 
Sometimes I'll rerun It if, like we've made an 
update and we need 11 back into M2. MCI Af,AP. I 
might ,-isl hke dtck on something I did the other 
day and rerun 11 cause those those. 
Data streams m RN2 MCI Is Just do,ng like a like a 
replace everyday when we run rt 
My one thing that I want to bnng up Is that. 
And I I'll reIteri1te this to Kyle.

I was loobng at the Redd,t mformallon that I had

missing spend. 
lntermrttently, acrou 111 of their campaigns fOf hke 
all of 2024 and 2025. they ended up havtng an 
issue with the platform that they had to Ilk• rec:t1fy 
lo get it coming through properly. 
When they were finally able, I opened this ticket m 
November, by the way. 
It's JUSt getting flXed. 
When I they were finally able to addreu the 1uue. 
they could only bMicfill fOf one yur to date. 50 
they were o™)' atM to 91!1 us fixed data from Apnl

But wtwt I had been doing .._ 
I've been pulmg. 
I was pulmg the stile range. 
And this happens, somellml!S too. 
hbmesout. 
VNyfun. 
I was puling for this bmeframe JUSI to comp.-e 
wtwt we had ong1nany pulled from the UI to 1H If 
rt matm@d and the good news 11, IS 11 don now 
the UI matchH for this tame frame. but as you can 
see like now we have OK we have. 
Data we have spend data Of cost data onboard 
from Apnl 9th. but we don"t haw anything for 
January, February. March up until Apnl 8th. So 
what? 
Were the engmeenng helped us f,x? 
Helped us fix. 
The tables. 
And get th.it data 901ng. 
But now we hilve to tw.te eog1neenng manually 
backfill Jinuary through Apnl 8th data and whilt 
they do there IS hke we ,ust al we do IS prOWH 
them UI reports 1n the fonNt that they nHd 11 and 
then they go tn and manu.ly ,w.nd ,t to the

And MCI match the UI for that for 1h11 date range. 
5o as you can SH, I was lookmg up hie• I ended up 
pulling in partner. 
I pulled in our lllcl! lpmm bra.-.d nam• and then I

Any questions?

I d on't think I mean everything you·re showing me

Get there 
() ::~ :b::1~::. 
And again, we'll, we'll do this again tomorrow. 
And we'll talk more about we'll just kind t show 
you the data stream s that we're getting from the 
export here and then we'll talk a little bit more 
again about the dashboard. 
And kind of go through 
Like what? 
Maybe we can even. I think they started submitting 
a few tickets. so maybe we can even talk about 
some of the tickets t hat the that the team has 
submitted. 
Umm. 
And then we'll go over Classific. 
We'll we'll do classifications next week and I'll show 
you l ike exactly what we've been doing there, like 
how we've been updating, how we've been QA 
ING. And then I think t hat"!I become a little bit 
more clear about Like, you'll see it like the actual 
updating of the clas.s. 
Always looks a little like crazy, but then once you 
see the report that we're pulling, you're gonna be 
like. 
Oh, this is like comparing 
lt 1t's almost. 
It's hke comparing the traffic workbook to like the 
t rafficking and hke having to like how we had all 
those old like true or false is set up like. That's 
pretty much what we've been doing and we just 
like wanna try to figure out how to automate that 
We don't have to, like, constantly look at it 
ourselves. 
So. 
But yeah.

s:::r :::a sensitNe. 
Like, it"s not like the videos are going in or nothing. 
Yeah, it's been a cool little adventure for you. 
How to use these hke more practical ways and 
saying here's 10 hours of Pre recorded video. I 
don·t know. You know everything, Let's go, 
I'm like, I know no. 
It's been helpful. Yep, I know. 
All right. cool 
So yesterday we talked about the Novartis 
dataawa how the data streams work. 
Going from so we get t he data from Snowflake, it 
goes to that data stream. It does the classification 
and then we export. 
We just like report export all of the data. 
Out into our end to data Rama. 
So in our end to data Rama, once you get access 
to analyze d ata connected mix. it looks exactly the 
same. But the only difference is is if you come to 
data streams list you're gonna 
You gonna look for? 
So there's a couple different ones here. So ler s talk 
about it. 
And I actually ! think they're just. I didn't need to 
export. 
No need in here. 
Oh, NBS feed. OK, so the reports that are coming 
from the N2 exports that are coming from the 
Novartis MCI come back into our MCI as NBS feed. 
So they're all able to NBS feed and they all share 
t he same like other name hke digital daily social 
like t hose all match. 
So you can you can line them up as you can see 
some of them are actually processing right now, 
Once that runs and that data ts in here and is 
successful, then we can actually look at things in 
t he dashboard. 
So if we•re waiting. 
If we're 1ook wait ing for an update from the 
Novartis side. MC1 or if we had to make an update 
in the snowflake once these run successfully, they'll 
be reflected m our dashboard. 
I think we recently updated all of t he feeds and 
everything to run. 
We run so from Snowflake into Novartis data 
Rama. 
Those fees are running every two hours. 
So they are. 
They're basically. 
They're updated constantly because we were 
running into some just like lag issues, but for our 
side. 
Data Rama. we·re only exporting twice a day, 
We're just doing that because when we did update 
everything, it was taking hours for like reports to 
generate in the NDS data. Rama. 
So like if we tried to like make a report tax for j ust 
like an ad hoc report, it was taking like 8 hours to 
generate. 
So we we updated this one, So if s only pulling 
from NOS dataama into ours. 
Twice a day. 
So somet imes 1f we're making an update. 
And it's a ticket that we got from activation saying 
it's wrong. 
In our datarama. we'll usually tell them like we've 
made the update check check tomorrow to see if 
you say 1t. Sometimes, hke, 1s there a set time or is 
11 just like, yeah, it is. 
I don't even know exactly. 
Yeah, you know. we do things. 
And I'm like when wi11 I actually see this? 
Yeah, I think we're doing like 7:00 AM. And then 
like 7:00 PM or something like that. 
So so that way we're getting if we are making 
changes throughout that day, we're getting it at 
night. And then if for some reason it skipped it like 
like we're making changes even later, we'll get it 
t he next day too, so. 
But yeah, so that that's pretty much where 
everything comes in through and then we will t hen 
be able to see the visualize and acl 
You will see some fees in here that say, I don't 
know if it's so. 
Yeah, you'll see some feeds in here that say social. 
You'll see some feeds in here that say SEM for. I 
don•t know why they labeled it SEM. but it's for 
search. 
We have search engine marketing, yeah 
And then I thi nk t here's a few ones that say DSP. 
No. 
No. 
Sstg apparently. 
Yeah, great. Great. 
Yeah. great naming, OK. 
So the ones that are labeled t his. 
ffi) 
CJ 


that are takmg t hat other path that I was talking 
about. 
So they're coming directly from the platform into 
our datarama and then taking the long route 1ike 
back into it versus like coming from redshift. 
I like to think of it as tike it's like it's traveling from 
EU, is up into everything coming back down versus 
like coming from redshift and then flowing 
downwards. 
So these are all the cuts of data that we can't get 
t hrough redshift that we need to get from the UI 
t hemsetves. 
So Redshift doesn't support deep intent as an API 
or batch file. 
Or they also don't support post point right now. 
So we get that data directly from like database. 
Exports and like from our own connections and set 
our MCI. Llnkedln hub media doesn't support. So 
we get that through a direct API into MCI and then 
t he search ones that I showed you are those 
additional cuts of data that we can't get through 
pubmedia where does red. 
Fall in that data flow chart. 
So Redshift is basically. 
Like tome. 
Is like for rNery cut of data that we can get it"s like. 
Step one. 
So like, once we have a new platform. 
Like if we were to get a new ad server or a new 
platform, the first thing t hat we would want to do 
is reach out to promedia and get a redshift API or 
batch file, load connection set up if they support it. 
So 1t's like after API before like MCI mm hmm. 
Briggs yeah. 
So like it basically. 
ls just an APls or does it take they do? 
Yeah. they do 
Files, I mean. yeah, they do. They do files too. 
We just send it like, what's the set back from just 
t he APls going directly into. 
Platforms so calls, so no. So the four oh lil(e for. 
I'll just circumventing pub media. 
Altogether and then like just going into MCI like 
what I mean. it sounds like redshift kind of falls. rt 
sounds like to me it falls here. 
Yeah, but like so, why not just put those d irectly 
into those if they Just not support all that data? 
So the PMAP 1s is like AKA redshift. 
Oh. OK. 
Yeah. So. like pub Media. AP is Pub Media uses 
redshift as their like warehouse for the API 
connectron. 
Yeah. So. yeah. no. I get it. 
And lil(e I we call t hings all different stuff. So like. 
Pub media. If we say pub media. we mean like 
redshift. 
If we are saying the A Pis we mean redshift because 
that's what they use. 
We are when we·re currently looking at lil(e rivery 
as tike an alternative to redshift and an alternative 
to pub media. AP is I found out from Jackie today. 
We are not calling it rrNerie when we're talking to 
the client, we're caHing it PHM APls. Of course. 
Yeah. So. 
Like to differentiate? Yeah. l 
I actually had Jackie tell me the other day that 
something we had to update all t he names. 
For apex. 
And pmx. 
For client facing data. 
Because t he account name did not like those 
names. so we changed them. yes. 
So that kind of stuff happens all the time. 
So yeah. so redshift is in that is in that initial stack. 
Thal is. as you can see. like the top three are 
together and they all follow the same flow and 
t hen the UI e-mail reports is like its own island and 
does its own and does its own little. 
Situation so 
So yeah. so. 
We we do this this way, I think again, redshift right 
now and using Comedia it's free and I like to say 
you get what yoo pay for because it's t here's a lot 
of issues. but it's free. 
We don"t have to worry about like overloading 
MCI. Lil(e if you bring in too much into MCI. 
Or do too many APls of Breal(lng Emerald data. 
Data you have to extend the rows which costs 
money. 
And so ifs like t he easiest way for us to do stuff 
Hopefully once we get rivery we can or start 
exploring RrNerie. We can get those addit ional our 
goa! like for Novartis point of view is that we 
would love to stop the Ul e-mail reports and just 
do rrNerie for those. 
And then second goal would be to use as much of 
Reverie to replace Redshift so that we remove the 
middleman. 
Of pub media to get the data, we can just do it 
ourselves. 
What is a realistic timehne that might happen so? 
I don't know, to be honest right now 
We're so I tried to set up. 
A try to set up Reddit in rrNerse because we were 
having all those issues with pubmedia like pulling 
in specs i;orrectly. 
Yeah. So I'll get you access to it. 
You can see it and like and check it out. 
We tried to do Reddit. 
We ran into a roadblock because Rivery does not 
support business accounts right now for Reddit. 
Which is l(inda weird. 


So we can't get rid of. 
So that"s that was one thing. 
I tried to set up meta this week because right now 
it loolts like there·s an option to select all the 
accounts in the Business Network. 
So to me that's like auto mapping like l"m like. Oh. 
can we launch a new account and we leave this 
empty for all? Is it just gonna grab all the 
accounts? 
Like so, l"m like, lef s test this out. 
So I pulled data this wee-k and 1 sent it over to Kyle 
to l ike can you compare? 
The redshift. 
The data that I sent through from Reverie, the raw 
data tables. 
Can you compare that to what we're getting from 
redshift and see- hke like are there additional 
columns that we're getting? 
Are t here columns that are missing? 
Saying can you check like the most commonly 
used metrics like impres-sions, clicb and spend to 
see if they match for l ike 2025? 
The one thing that t saw that I flagged was I do not 
see an option for OMA data. 
At least especial ly because Novartis uses all of its 
analysis at the OMA level so. 
We I'm like we can t echnically use the. 
We can. if they don't do DMA we could technically 
use rivery to populate some of our dashboarding. 
But it still does not solve the issue for like l"m like it 
doesn't make sense for us to like split it between 
redshift and reverie like it was just to me. It would 
be like one or the other. 
So it's going to be interesting. 
Ifs just a lot of leg work and invest igation. Just like 
nothing we can do like. 
If if everything has an ID on it and data briclts can 
like re append a DMA based off o f that. 
Is that possible? 
I mean, I gues-s we could 
I guess we could do that, but like the one, I guess 
the one issue is is that. 
Like we wouldn't have 
The. 
Like you're saying. like grab the data from Rivery 
and then use like ADMA automated report into 
data Brok to like append. Yeah. Yeah. Data breab 
had some kind of like knowledge to be able to 
check out like these IDs. And t here t here have to 
be some kind of. 
Key somewhere, yeah. 
Arid if it matches up t hen we could just re append 
it before it goes in the snowflake. 
I make ii sound easy. but I'm sure it's not but 
The auto selection is the is.sue so. 
In Meta, if you set up an automated report, it's 
going to only pull for the accounts you selected at 
that point in time and won't pull in any new 
account s. So you have to like go in and select al! 
the accounts again. 
To bucket everything. 
But that's not a bad idea though. like if we could. 
If we could have. 
Does somebody go in when they're doing? 
If we could j ust have someone go in once a month 
on the 1st and just regrab all the accounts for the 
OMA level data, that could solve for that 
That could turn the whole when I get a better feel. 
Yeah, no. 
But that's that's perfect. 
That's like the like. That's exactly like you're getting 
Like, that's like, that's the kind of like that's. that's 
the kind of like thinking that we need to do here. 
So you're you're on the right track. 
That's like, that's great, ·cause. I didn't even l like, 
totally didn't think about appending a date to 
break data breaks for me has been such out of 
sight. out of mind, and I need to stop with that 
because it could be such so. 
Useful. 
So yeah. I've, I mean. l have very little experience 
obviously with all these, but I have like a poke 
around data bricb and I've seen like examples of 
its power and that's the part that excites me the 
most is also like t he most complex like you have 
lo. 
Know code. 
Yeah, to do it. 
So I just round up my stuff with like Guinea •0
••. 
Let me see. 
Especially with Esteban goes you sell. It's great. 
So I yeah. 
And stuff like that. 
Yeah, I'll. I'll make sure I keep sniffing him, but I do 
get nervous sugge<;ting things in front of them. 
Posting are so smart. 
You guys already thought of everything and then 
sometimes when you're explaining something on 
calls before. I'm like, my first thought is go to hell. 
You want me to? 
Then we do this like, oh. you guys already thought 
of that? 
Did it implement it and it works? 
This is not the vibe I was getting. 
So yeah. I've. I meal\ J have very little expenence 
ob\110us!y with all these. but I have like a poke 
around data bncb and I've seen like examples of 
its power and that's the part t hat excites me the 
most is also like the most complex like you have 
lo. 
Know code.

Posting are so smart. 
You guys already thought of everything and then 
sometimes when you're explaining something on

You want me to? 
Then we do this like, oh. you guys already t hought 
of that? 
Did it implement it and it works? 
This is not the vibe I was getting. 
So yeah. rve, I mean. t have very little experience 
obviously with all these, but I have like a poke

~~is.is ~ot the vi~~ l.~~s ~ett~n2 .... ...,_ .. , __ .,_., 


and like competitor data. 
Which was like auction data, but we can't get the 
auction piece of it anymore. So we only get it for 
branded impression share. 
I hate this report. Like with a passion. 
This report is a night mare. 
Let me show you what it does. 
Let me show you the the steps that it takes. 
Oh. 
Yeah. Welcome to your nightmare. 
Indeed. t hat's exactly what it is. 
I've st ruggled. Kyle and I struggled with t his report 
so much that we have now so much 
documentation on ii because it's awful. 
So this report the only way to get data correctly 
for this report is if we feed our classifications into 
custom fields within search ADS 360. So what we 
do? 
I'll give you access to lucid chart too. 
I think you'll have a lot of fun with this. 
Chris introduced me to this and Chris has been 
making all burKh of different things in here. 
0~ 
So what is going here is that we have the UI report 
right? 
Where sending that into our data analytics. 
This is going mto Snowflake, probably hitting data 
pars on the way. I don't know. 
It's just going to show 
And then it goes into Novartis data Rama. 
At this point if there are no ciassifKation update to 
the search information, it's j ust gonna go right 
bad: into our hke it's gonna do the reimmersion 
process. 
It's gonna. 
You know. whatever. 
And then it's gonna go back into rmci. OK? 
A side process that's happening is that. 
There's a delivery going to the Azure BLOB with 
the classification information. 
If there is a classification update made to the 
search information. 
It's reflecting in BLOB and then it's getting passed 
into a like. Basically a bulk reporting action 
ingestion action. 
Into SA 360. 
In order to populate like custom dimensions in 
search ads, yeah. 
And then those actions can then be generated in 
the report that we're t hen setting to MCI like. 
If you don't get it. I don"t blame you. 
Like it? 
It's cracy. but basic.ally let me show you the report. 
I think showing you the report we'll make will help 
tie it together. 
Bye bye. 
So basic.ally. 
We're feeding. 
We're basically feeding this report. 
RN2 reporting and RN two branding names and 
our end to funoel names as custom dimensions in 
SA360. 
In order to get t hese in here. 
That is why our classifications m the Novartis data 
Rama have to go to Azure in order to come back in 
the SA 360 because the report has to. 
Has to be exported from SA 360. 
In this format . Otheiwise we can't classify it the 
way that we need it yeah. 
That's all it's doing. It's just. 
It's just providing classifications within search as 
36'l. 
The problem with this is that if this if, if there's no 
updates right. 
If it's doing this whole process. but there's no 
updates. it's just a few. 
It's j ust like two business days or it's just going 
here. here. here, Reimer in no changes. OK we got 
it in MCl but if a change has to occur. it has to 
make sure ii makes it through this process. 
And t hen it has to repeat t he process again. 
Does that make sense? 
Yeah. OK 
So like, how do we know when something has 
changed? 
Does it overwrite the old one? 
Is 1t a new report? 
Yeah, it. So it'll CM:"rwrite it. 
The only problem with it is t hat ii takes like seven 
days for ii to do it 
Yeah, the the bottleneck is Just basically like. 
It's like figure like one day to get to MSCI. 
Getting here i mmediately. so same day. 
Same day. 
Probably 2 days OK. 
We shortened it down by we we defimtely shorten 
it shortened it down by changing the cadence of 
delivery between Snowflake and MCI. 
So it's like probably 1. 
12234 like it's like S days now. Yeah, so. 
But the problem with this is that we are only 
ingesting this report for last for last month and 
then up until we have a we have Asov report for 
last month and then we have an SOV report daily 
that pulls like month to date 
OK if our activation team. 
Says hey. 
Our like SRV like our impression share is showing 
up in the wrong account or whatever or the wrong 
place. 
There's chance ii could be been occurring for 
months. so if that happens, we have to come in 


here and do a one t ime run of the report from like 
December so that it can capture the new capture 
the the SOV. 
Classification for a time frame that day like missed. 
I absolutely hate this process. I Kyle. 
And me spent hours trying to track how how this 
actually works. 
Because David. are you familrar with David 
Haberman? 
OK. You you I think you you would have really liked 
him. 
He is like he I worked with him at my old agency 
too. and then I worked with him here. 
Smart man could figure out crai.y stuff like insane 
t hings. However, had a aversion to documentation. 
So he showed me like he was j ust like. hey. set up 
t hese new reports in your name so that they 
continue to n.m. And then was just like. that's it. So 
when it broke. 
I was like. l don't know how to fix this. 
He just told me to set up a report. 
So he figured this process out. 
But Kyle and I spent hours trying to track down, 
like trying to track down what. 
Like this was basically. 
If it breaks, I'd honestly say just like I'll do it fOf 
now until you get familiar. This isn't as important 
because you do. 
We do have people who understand how it works. 
As you get more familiar, I think it'll start to make a 
little bit more sense 
Thanks. If I see a time it works. 
See you time. It doesn't work. 
0~ 
That's out of memory. Yes, exactly. 
But this is this is exactly what we're trying to solve 
for by trying to do verbatim. 
Like we don't wanna do this anymore 
We don't want UI reports. 
We wanna be able to get the cuts of data in the 
way that we need it within Reverie custom cuts so 
that we can just abandoned UI reports. We do not 
wanna do UI reports. 
So yeah. so that. 
And it's pretty much all, oh, rm in the wrong. 
That is pretty much all that we do here. 
For the dimensions that we were talking about 
yesterday, so like as I was saying, we create 
classification for the data. 
In the Novartis MCL 
We don't really creole ony type of clossification 
here, but what we do 1s we sometimes pull m like. 
Umm. 
Yeah, we I'm gonna ignore it 
We don't really do classrtications and the N2. MCI. 
we pull a11 of the classifications from like the report 
t hat get s sent over to us. So we don't make any, 
we don't moke any calruloted dimensions in t he 
N2. MCI. So anything that we're doing 
classificallon wise. 
Should be occurring in the Novartis MCI, OK. 
That's pretty much all that is on the connect. The 
next tab for us here. 
Reporting you can like generate reporting that you 
want like. 
You can generate reporting that you need to hear, 
like just showing what's in the N2. MCI typically 
don"t do that. 
I generate all my reporting and then Novartis MCI 
because that's technically like to me that's like 
source of truth. 
We're just like passing source of truth data to this 
platform. 
Pivot tables. I use a lot j ust to check !ike stuff that's 
on the visualization and the dashboards that we do 
in in our own end end to MCI and then the last 
thing that I have here is. 
Database exports. 
This is basically how we're getting. 
The PULSEPOINT data, the deep intent data when 
we were using perform media, that's how we were 
getting that the Linkedln data. 
These are all the different exports that are 
happening from this end to MCI to send ti to like 
data perks and stuff like. 
Cool. 
Other than that we went over the. 
We kind of just went over the dashboards at the 
teoms ore using. 
I'd say Azure like just you know onboarding. 
Just take a look. 
Just get familiar with like what the teams are 
looking at. 
Let me know if you have any like questions about 
certain metrics or why we pull something in from 1 
channel but not another channel. 
If you need clarification on any of t he metrics that 
we're pulling in, because this is gonna be like. 
This is going to be important because this is what 
we're communicating with the team about like this 
is what we·re creating and managing for, like the 
activation teams. 
Cool and everything else clicking around, I see this 
little blue buttons t hat remind me of the toggling 
t hings I was like. Oh, did I just change that view for 
everybody? 
If I did not started bumping things in different 
parts like I put it back. 
Oh yeah. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
You're good, you're able. 
You're able to like do whatever you want. like in 
t he octual dashboard. put your current access. 


Yeah, cool. 
Any any immediate questions here? 
Don·t be interested. 
Search personal hke what is the most common ask 
that I will be assigned probably to do. 
Yeah, yeah. 
So I'd say what we're what you're gonna be focus 
on is. 
Basically I we. 
In the N2 datarama. I'd say the ticketing cause like 
any t ickets that you get from our internal teams. 
are gonna be about what they're seeing in this 
dashboard. So as I was mentioning the other day. 
like I'm trying to create something helpful for you 
guys, so t hat. 
You can. 
Like if you g et a ticket about something of t his 
nature, here's the steps t hat you take. 
To t ry to troubleshoot where t he issues occurring 
and how lo fix ii. 
So you what I atways say is like if you get a ticket 
about something that's weird in t he dashboard 
and they send you a screenshot try to mirror their 
screenshot first. 
Sometimes it's a user error. 
You know how it is, but if it you're seeing the s.ame 
thing, t hen you can slart taking the 
troubleshooting steps. 
So it'll be mostly viewing and then we'll get you set 
up like. 
There once you get I think the license access you 
can come Into like the work in progress 
dashboards and you can like create your own 
dashboard and start like trying to bring stuff in and 
like get famil iar with like the widgets and stuff like 
that. It kind of. 
Almost feels like. 
I don't know. 
It kinda like when I was kinda trying to set stuff up 
and like do some stuff I like. l I'm not graded at 
right now. but I was trying to do like. 
You can come in everyone. 
And I was trying to like set up stuff that like 
basically tells people when they tagged wrong. 
But you can j ust like play around like like start your 
own dashboard, start making widgets and try to 
pull in like certain data. 
Like certain dimensions and metrics. 
Because t hen I think end goal is that you can help 
Kyle build dashboards like any new dashboards 
that we need. !f somebody's like, we sometimes 
get a request for dashboard enhancements. 
So if they're like, hey, this doesn't really work for 
me. like. can we do like XY and Z in this 
dashboard? 
We assess it, we see. 
Like. 1s this gonna work? 
~s this impact anybody else? 
And ifwe can accommodate it. we'll incorporate it 
So that's pretty much that'll be your extent in the 
Novartis one is just doing the ticketing helping 
create dashboards and edit dashboards in the 
You should feel I would. I would say you're gonna 
need to feel pretty com comfortable navigating 
pivot tables to check source of truth data of like, 
hey, are we getting what we need from Snowflake 
correctly? 
If something d assified incorrectly and we'll go over 
classifications and how you could check that kind 
of stuff next week. 
But. 
The the Novartis MCI it'll be. 
That I don't like an act tab. You gotta feel 
comfortable on. And the connectomex so like 
looking at the data streams and then looking at 
the classifications. 
So yeah. you say pretty much most or all of our 
tasks and datarrama is realty just viewing QA like 
we are like. are we actually editing? 
Yeah, like editing the dashboards. 
Yeah, ·cause, it sounds like we're kind of moving 
things around. 
I mean between like pivots and. 
And some of the other stuff you showed me, like 
we're looking at this, but then we probably go to 
somebody and say, hey, we're missing search data 
or missing this, but we aren't actually putting like 
are we? 
We we create the dashboards well, right? 
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah. 
But to look at the other data that's coming in like 
we aren't. I think I'm asking it wrong, but I 
ul'lderstand what you're saying. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are creating that and working 
in it but. 
I didn't think of an example, but it's also good. Like 
are we? 
Are we? How are like? 
If we solve a problem with some of the data 
coming in. we wouldn't go like into th;it like that 
report like go back. 
Well I guess you s.aid you we would maybe in 
redshift sometimes or? 
So yeah. Yeah. hold on. 
I let me pull up the 
I'm gonna pull up the data flow again. 
So we're basically, if we're basically responsible for. 
Like. 
We're. I'm trying to think how to put this. We're 
responsible for MCI and ensuring the- data is 
correct there. 
We are responsible. 
For ensuring the data is correct 3nd snowflake, 
however, and we are also responsible for QA ING 


between and. I had this in the troubleshooting 
steps too, which will probably help too if we are 
having an issue so like. 
Let's go. 
Just go through the the missing or discrepan 
I clicks from like DCM right? 
Fo, 
So l have the steps here. 
So if somebody is saying we have missing 
impressions, right? 
We gotta check the UI is the data m the UI. Let's 
export that data. 
So is data m DCM OK? 
Let's export th;it DCM dat.i. Then we're gonna 
ched::: Snowflake 
The snowflake matched the UI. 
If it doesn't then we're gonnil. If it does. then 
we're gonna check the Novartis data, Rama. 
Gonna ask a bunch of questions of the Novartis 
data Rama our classificat ion's right. 
Are the different dimensions matching like our 
like? Do the dev live and reimmersion dimensions 
all say the same thing basically' 
Are the data streams running? 
Are the exports running? 
Are the and two data streams running? 
So, like. there·s a lot to check in 1n t he in MCI. 
And then if we get stuck there, t hat's when we 
have to talk. right? 
However, if Snowflake doesn't m;itch the UI. we 
have to check redshift. lf Redshift matches the Ul, 
t hen the issue isn't Snowflake. 
That's when we go to engmeering. 
They look into what the issue is there. 
If Redshift doesn't match the UI. then we have to 
open up a ticket with pub media because it's a pub 
media issue. Does that help? 
Yeah. OK. 
Just raise a question bizarrely. 
l"m with you. 
11 love the shoot too. 
OK.OK. cool. 
Yeah, hke this should help you be able to pin 
because this ,s again something that I feel like I 
got thrown in the ticketing and I was just kind of 
like the gift of like. like Travolta, like in Pulp Fict1on. 
Like, where do I go? 
So this like I think if I knew this to start I could 
have shaved like 
Months off my onboarding so. 
But yeah, you'll get used to it as we go along, but 
b;isically tike. 
We are JUSI response. 
They give rt. 
We are JU st responsible for ensuring that the data 
flow is occurring and every and the data goes from 
t he inject from the initial point of ingestion. all the 
way to data Rama correctly. 
The PLO side, we have semi responsibility on but 
luckily we do have like Theresa, Patti and Chaitanya 
and like Roger to help us out with if we're having 
like issues there because they're like. 
The PLO export experts and the vendor manage 
like the vendor management for that. So 
Cool. 
But yeah, I will. 
l"d say like next few days, just like play around in 
the visualization part of our N2 datarama. 
Check out the dashboards and then. 
On M onday, we're gonna connect and go through 
classifications. 
I still, to be perfectly honest with you. I still find 
classifKations confusing. 
Because. 
They're not. 
Not currently set up efficiently and like Jackie has 
acknowledged it and like it's j ust the way that we 
currently have everything set up. 
Was to accommodate. 
Bad activation for like a number of years. 
Like bad taxonomy, bad choices, bad stuff like that. 
But we have gotten taxonomy on Novartis to a 
point where it has been the cleanest it's ever been. 
So now we can. 
We're we're trymg to worlc on a way to leave those 
classifKations as is in the past for past data and 
then rebuild classifications for like 2025 onward. 
So. 
When I show you the classifications next week. 
Don't hke, get overwhelmed because it once you 
start looking at it it'll make sense 
Like t he more you look at 11, the more it'll make 
Yeah. 
22. 
Are these old? 
Nah. these these might be old 
Oh. 
I don't know 
That's a great question 
Creat ive level. 
So it's not my problem. 
No. but yeah, the we"re we're, we"re working on a 
few different t hings like I was trying to come up 
with a creative like error report that basically is like. 
Showing t hem like, hey, did you set up an 
impression tracker that's supposed to be tracking 
sends or opens? And we have no impressions for? 
Something is wrong like. 
Do we have i mpressions like video creative 
metrics? 


Error report, This is supposed to show them if they 
named something to be served. 
One way, and what they need, and if it doesn't 
have t hat you know like so. 
Thea, we've been trying to work through this. 
Is this basically got like? 
It's basically a back burner because there's like 100 
other things going on. but these are t he kind of 
t hings that it's like. oh. we can probably use a 
dashboard for that or like we find out a team 
member has been creating a mc1nuat report off of 
like. 
20 different exports thc1t they received like no. no. 
let's just build a dashbwrd for you. 
So thc1t's like. thc1t's like whc1t we do. part of what 
we do for the team. 
Great . Yeah. OK. 
Hi are we having excel sheets to track the task in 
JIRA? Just make a ....... dashboard. 
Wouldn't do so. 
rm in my own. 
I don't blame you. 
I wouldn't do the same thmg. 
Oh coot 
But yeah, and then. 
I guess really quickly. let me just show you. 
So I gave you and Kyle access to the. 
Social nomenclature tool and the search as or the 
search request one. 
So yeah. so basically. 
This Is Us trying to be pre emptive and like ask pub 
media to automap it. 
Like to map an account so we can get data when it 
launches versus. 
The current way that we have it where we like 
launched and like have data and we're missing 
data. 
So now we have to do a backfill. They take weeks 
to do backfill. 
So we're trying to like be like. hey, we got a new 
account coming coming down the line. please map 
it so that when it starts, we just get data 
automatically so. 
What l built out this tool for social earlier this year 
to get them to. 
Get t hem to standardize their names ·cause they 
were not standardized. It was awful. 
And now what I did was ! Just added on the side a 
place for them to drop t he account !D and to just 
check if we have been granted access. 
When we get the. 
ID ,:11\Cl I'd say honestly, even if they don't do the 
access thing, Just still submit It. 
But when we get the ID and the account name 
when they add it m here, immediately open up a 
t icket with pub media and be hke map. This 
account for us so that way we can try to get them 
to map it in the same time frame that. 
Like social Is trying to launch and hopefully get the 
data immediately 
We don't have to do it for Unkedln be<:c1use as I 
said like mentioned, we're getting. 
We just have a dire,:;t. 
APl tab to to Datarama Burlington because pub 
Media doesn't doesn't handle Unkedln doesn't 
have Al. 
Guess contract with them. 
So that's j ust where you'll find that data there and 
then. 
For search. it looks exactly the same. 
I think you·11 appreciate the search sheet that I 
created for this account because 
We do so much for them outside of j ust creating 
the search advertiser. 
Cool. So anytime search has a new advertiser, they 
fill out a form and it gets submitted to media te<:h. 
And it builds out the advertiser name that they're 
gonna use in the platform. 
That media te<:h sheet from box and put it in 
smartsheet form so we can actually actually use 
the automation to notify us exactly what 
happened. 
Yes. And then I. 
We get the account ID. 
Is for Google ads because they map to Prisma 
which Is great. 
We see that Goog~ ads account. 
Giving up no. 
We have another You Tube account. 
And we're probably gonna have to ask the same 
question. 
Oh no. OK. 
Oh. OK. 
There's the CSU on. 
Oh ••••. 
Wait a minute. 
No. So where? 
I'm going to. 
I'm gonna update the notifications to not ify us. 
Uh. 
When there is. 
A. 
I wonder if I can update it to look for a word in this 
column. 
So we can know when a You Tube account is 
commg. 
Demo line so we can get the Google ads data for 
You Tube. I'll figure that out but. 
I know what else going to be besides You Tube or 
imply!. Yeah. right. So hopefully. 
Julie. Yeah. Well then again, never ceases to doubt

:e :~:mg about ~st we~ 
With Novartis. 
Wedo. 
X 
A lot of work to claSSlfy the data that we're gettmg. 
And all the different channels m the Novartis. MCI, 
Again. the one that has, like the big Novartis name 
on It and the Salesforce logo on t~ nght side, we 
do classifications here and I think rt's important to 
know like h1storicals here because like I think it'll 
make a lo1 more seose about why. 
I this is gomg to seem a hltle coovoluted. 
Basically. 
In the past we've done this here becat.1se I I'm 
under the assumptJOn we did this tier because of 
the fact that we did not r.ave. 
Super Strong SOL coding. People on the account. 
so it's a lot easier to write like. 
Data Rama based SOL in Datarama itself and I also 
think that the people in the account at the time so 
like Jackie and DaVJd Haberman and a few other 
people, they were really expenenced In data Rama 
speofically. 
So I think II was JUSt like low hanging fruit like lefs 
JUSt put thcs in here. 
We know how to use rt. 
We koow how to wnte It 
Will JUSt WIii JUSI dump it here. 
Fast forward. 
Like 5--6 years !a1er, 1h1s Is 001 the best platf0<m to 
do this m like I've been working in this for \Ike 8 
months and you cao JUst see that this is not the 
best place to do this in to the scale that we are 
domg ll 
Data Rama is not scalable so t know we've talked 
about th1S a few times. 
Like, th.ifs like the besl part aboul hav,ng a date 
of birth 50Und hke a snowflake ,s al their scalable. 
So if something"s slow, you can make rt faster. You 
can't do that with data Rama. So the more you add 
m here. the more ,t slows everything down. 
So. 
ti's it's goUen to be a beast and I'm going to s~ 
you th,s because we are st1I operating business as 
usual. 
For a Novartis, by doing the dass1f1Cab0ns in 
Datorama. However, we've been talking with. 
I talked with Chns and Kyle about rt a couple 
months ago and twas hke, 11 does not make sense 
to have Uu year. 
Where can we do clas$1fiCat1ons that would make 
sense? 
Do we do this in Snowflake and after talking aod 
h,w1ng like kind of Just a bramstorm,ng sessI00. 
we're like all every dtent at PHM. 
Uses date of births. so we should probably do 
classifications 1n data brides. because then 1f we 
onboard a new. 
Client we can just copy and paste like dale of 
birth's notebooks hke 1nlo a new chent instance 
and data and data bf1cks and then people could 
Just ed,t those workbooks like as they need It and 
mstead of having a copy and paste every single 
lhmg tha1 we. 
Set up in MCI and do screen shares. 
And have access issues and ,I'll Just take a lot less 
time to ooboard a client but rt's also a better place 
to do 11 ,n because again it's scalable. 
So for now. we·re still doing this the way the old 
way Is. What I hke to call it. 
In the Novartis MCL we're gonna, we·re having 
GSK. 
Test out bu1td1ngs out d assrfications m databnclcs 
to see if we can test the functionality like Novarbs 
,s not the client. 
To do that on and then if evt'f)'thing is going 
accordmg to plan, we're go,ng at some point to 
port everything thal -
•ve done in dmnerama over 
to data PERC. 
One other h1stoncal note here rs that the reason 
why these are so conduded aod so long and so 
complex is because of the h1slory of, hke bad 
activation. bad taxonomy, bad, like not followmg 
the rules. not doing 0A like all the things that 
should have been happening just. 
Not happeo1ng. 
So there's a lot of sl\lff In here 
That Is was created based on cleaning up. 
Bad taxonomy and bad data.. 
We're In a better spol now, so a lot of that stuff is 
oo longer like needed for current day data, bul we 
have to leave 11 there because ,f somebody deades 
they wanna pull hke four yea~ w<>rth of data. we 
still need that The older stuff to Just 
Be clean and like show the '!iilme hke be

2025 data. 
So that being said. that S why I hatt this,, ~H 1t 
rt really 1$hk•. 
The best w.ay I an dHcnbe ll IS th.at. 
Like question ewrythlng. 
Becaubous.1.Jtelfyouonc1you ~1,ro;,ot,,ed into 
actually doing the CYUlfK..IOons. I told K)W to kb. 
Thmt. smaD inste.ad of b1Q pctUrt 
With tMSe c:uwf1C.1bons. we r.-i tmo a few IWJft 
last '/H!l where. hte K~ w.n uymg to dNn up the 
dassdic..atJons. but then rt was wn~. 
Other things from years poor 
So I had to tell him to Ilk• lond of pcvot to ltop 
m.aklng like over.arching code and rully JUSt try to 
do hke ovemdes. 
And I know rt's llke .adding to tM llntt that .art 
going to be m here. but ~kt that's .all wt a n do 
right now until we can. 
Actually proJecl hke. 
Do a clean up .and hke port 0v1r to d 1t1 of birth 
like we can"!Just be like. 
Cleanmg up .and remoY1ng th1n9s and addmg 
things and trymg to bucket t.hmgs }Ul't ~use of

I.I W.11.. So .

What's lite .a 11m@l,n1? I'm sony . 
.. Andrf!WllyM'I 6,0 
When do you thmk ag.am hkt ttyt would be in 
data bncks we can7 
So where do you forelff we stop butldmg on this 
Jenga tower and 11."s finally over to thl ntwway to 
do it ? 
u
:~~-h~ 
CluestlOfl. So we're (JOflN st.art 1xplonng m0Y1ng 
stuffover. 
Afte,- thi$ current th15 upcom1t19 tpmm ()'CM. so our 
1pmmcyde11. 
They're gorv1.1 bl look.Ing at. So Novar115 • gonna 
be ... the weeds loobng .at ~ta fl"om ... .aspKb 
from June to middle of Ju,y. 
So they typQIJy bombard us w,t.h qul'StJOnS. 
They're co~ntly puling~ during that 
tJme f~me. We"r1 g,onN talk. 
l"I t.Jlk to )'OU guys .about 1t. but W1"r1 9C)IV\I WI 
do. 
Four different dass1fic.at10n upd.atu where hkt If 
it's a single overnde of a current campaign. 
l et's do 1t. 
But 1f ifs hke an overarching ltkt. let's complttfl)' 
Or let's completely movt this 1nd,cat10n t o this new 
name. Like, we're not gonna bl able to do 11 until 
Novartis stops look.mg at the data. because then 1t 
impacts everything that they're pulling on their 
end. 
So we get through 1pmm •nd then WI Slart, we 
start loolung .at porting ov.r. 
And we'_.. only 901ng to port 0\ltt things I.ha! 
impact 2020. hke we·re b.aslc.ally 90(11\a 900na 
build code for 202.S amp•igns onw-ard. 
So~ of the old cbulfic.alJON are 90fW\.I remaan., 
datar.1nu for ltk1 the 2020 to 202, ~ta. 
And thin al the rww dJl5sific.abonl •• go,ng to 
come in from databncb. hkt th.ah the end ~I 
So that .al the dnslfic..11,on in ct.all bncb 15 dean 
because now our wa,nomy is dtan. 
:i Andrf!W~I.A7 
O<. 
o::;:,:~ 
So yeah. hopefully aft-. prob.ably August. w1·11 
start movmg stuff over. 
We'll see how GSK II going. 
We'll see 1f we can. 
They bas1Calty use some of the code th•t wt like. 
Kyle's been helpmg !hem out • ht1l1 bit with both 
their hke datarilma build •nd their databr,cks build. 
So he's been kind of copy •nd pas11ng some of the 
baseline code that we have •nd they've bffn 
tr.Jnslat1ng 1t lo SOL And then •k• dear11ng rt up 
and making rt wh.at he wai tl)'lng to do. 
lnthefnt p&.c1 m., ours. hi IS now U')'W'lgtodo 
with them ro 1n. like dat.Jbnc:b and whatnot. So. 
O<. 
Sothais.alofthedasslfK..at,onthat Wldofot the 
data are ., the CMaJUlted ckmlnslOn5 fitld. And as 
I was Sil)'ll"l9 the odwr day. rm p,obabfy90f'M\.I 
come ., .and add Nl at the at the end 0' the 
begmn1ng of .aH of t~ so that. 
We c.an parse out ou" beause they thef1·s • 
bunch of stuff ,n heft I.hat thal 1sn·t ours and 
there's a bunch of stuff that is, but rt's hard to tell 
what 1s what. so. 
I do have a 11st of things like. Typic•lly if something 
So that's how you !hat's hke an easy way off the 
bat to see like what we're doing versus what 
somebody else 1s doing 


Not everyone has a dev, so that's why I'm hke, we 
do have to get this cleaned up a htt1e bit 
·cause it's it's a little hard to naV19ate. 
But as you can see we h.ave hke different.

Andrew Ryan 10:27 
You're you're not shanng your scrHn. Rachel.

There we go .

And there we go . 
._ 
Andrew Ryan 10-.36 
Alnght now we'r@ cru,smg. 
~Piot 10:,40 
Oil 
So agam. bke thlS IS really difficult to get through. 
So. 
They If you 1oc::. for somebody that has a dev. ,rs 
ours. but not everything has a dev. 
So that's why I'm like we have to come m here and 
clean it up because ,rs it's h.ard to tell what IS ours 
and whatnot 
But 
As you can see. we have qurt.e a few dasstficahons 
that we're doing. 
And I hallt' a document on box that I can send you 
that kmd of h5ts out. What all of these d1mens1ons 
are hke? 
What all of these hke mean? 
Like what? They what? They tie back to? 
Until you get hke a little used to like what each one 
does. I think the ones that were typically m the 
most tend to be like very hkeJUSI the brand name 
like making sure the brand names nght making 
sure the mdicat!Oll is nght. 
Makmg sure the audience Is nght that it's HTP or 
OTC. 
Malong sure the pramc Is nght. 
Is It branded or unbranded so? 
We typically use hke a lot of same ones 011er and 
over and OW1' again. but rH send you that or I'll 
pul up the document ma little btt. 
So you can see hke what what IS what. 
Well rm gonna happen to ,ust one that we use 
frequently. 
ti's brand report name. 
So this ts what I1 loob like when you come m here 
and the code Is at the bottom so you can make ti 
full screen. 
What you could do too is like sometimes like I'll 
copy and paste this out of here and put rt m like a 
OneNote. 
To manipulate some stuff. 
But as long as you're working m dev like what I 
suggest 1s 1f you're playing around a dev, Just copy 
and paste the code that's currently m !here before 
you start like. 
Doing stuff and then you can hke make edtts and 
dev as you need. 
It's not gonna impact anything that hke N011artts ts 
looking at bot as long as hke we have the prev1ous 
code m case there's like a maJor issue that we can't 
fix. we Just bnng the old code back. 
So basic.ally at the top IS ,ust going to be all of the 
like references. 
So like what this code Is going to be referenang 
and pu1hng m? 
So rf you JU~ like type m like. 
Vanable and then whatever you want lo c.all 
something. 
So like say I want to bfmg In a partner, l'd be M;e 
p.irtner or hke part equals and then once you. 
See the brackets.. 
You can type In any of the dimens10ns that we 
currently hallt' in Met and find 11 and then. That 
way when you go to write your code, all you have 
to do is wnte partner or part and then 11 will pull 
fromthal 
Dimension that currently exists m order to make a 
ca(cutated dimension. 
So like 1f I wanted to do partner, I would probably 
look for partner. 
Umm. 
There's also hke drfferent Immermns I like. 
I would suggest uS1ng the regular partner field. 
That's like alre~ made m here versus there any of 
the re1mmernons. I would only use the 
reImmersK>11S for like ~ually like pulling reports 
on the analyze and~ tab. 
But yeah you could. 
Just like add m the partner and then I could start 
Wfitmg code that bnngs In the partner 1f 1f I 
needed to. 
So that's all that this like all that. this sKtton rs 
doing is JUSl. 
Adding m. 
All of the dimensions we're gomg to be usmg m 
order to create a new dimension and then Just 
some substitutions. 
So again, I'm not the best coder. 


So hke I typiully when I first startad do11"19 this. I 
would JU51 com• m here and I would JUSt try to 
check out like, wNt 15 gomg 0n. If ther• WU 
something that I dtdn t rKOg~. hie• I dldnl 
know l:he length codM bafor._ 
Or the length. 
I dldnl know th. coal Ins so. I would pt bk.e 
Google and be ICe. what does this do7 
loot for UM mo5t part. 
We•re not wnting anything Ilk• Ml MW m h<tre 
We·re JUSI: like If the-re IS• new instance of 
somethng that needs to be dH.Slfied • d,ffffent 
W<Jy. 
We're JUst cunently kind of hke m1rronng whit 
<Jlre<J<fy exist m here. 
So <J lot of this stuff like. 1911n this 1s for Brand 
rl:'portnoilme. 
So we're trying to crHte a clun report name. 
So a couple llke one that ,s. 
Like you could do here. 
Right. Like so this one ts rf brand equals V Joyce 
and lhl:'fl the camp11gn also contains Ludo, which 
used to be like the old code for B Joyce. 
The new brand name IS 90mg to brt lud1thar1. 
So this IS what's 901ng 10 show when you pull In 
Brand report n.11me and this 1s how hb the 
campaigns are gotng to be 199rtg.1ted under. 
~rdJess ofWNt they hl-v9 m the NAV, joyce or 
the campaign name of loud.

rules that we currently have. and th11 1s how I was 
saying, hke at this point m time, we're probably 
gonna say Just do a one olf owrnde instead ol 
gomg 1n and hke com~t•ly r~01ng code. That's 
what we can. 
Get the new daulfat>OoS made. so thts 1s a 
perfect example. 
So we Md a couple one off Ollltfndes here. 
M~ did them last year. 
Those go ,lit the bottom and thoM onH •• rol

I can't. The more you Krol~ the mOfe. the more. 
It's hke. wow, this 1s extremely not scalable. 
It's getting so alarm~. 


Ifs so bad. like you can see I did a few hke one

potting patches on the boat and keeping rt moving

thrs like the way It's supposed to be. 
Because now we have alreitdy dean taxonomy 
which we did not have before. 
•• And,_ Ryan 23:3-f 
At what point do you would you s.ay It like the 
taxonomy made a big shift to being dean? 
like I I know it's probably a rolling thing, but hke 1s 
there kind of 1/4 year like you could say around 
here huge upgrade and that's when this all 
happened.

The ~l:e the begmrnng of last year. OK. cool. 
(.) = 
:h. ·=ewe had a few when~ did the 
when we did the merger wrth like Starcom. 
And I had to start peeking into then campaigns 
and. hke. place and campaign manager, I was like, 
what m the absolute world Is going on here? 
Like It was so bad. No creative taxonomy .

Andrew Ryan 2,4:28 
Oh yeah.

And. 
When Jadoe 1nhented them too 1l she's •t:e I spent 
hke, an entire year JUSt trying to clau1fy, ldc.e. their 
the data ffom the Starcom side. because 
everything, nothing follow the structure. 
So yeah.

Andrew Ry.,, 2S:02

There a whole rehaul happened and a whole

got people on board with like you have to do this 
because then the client is going to. 
You like leave if you don't 
And. 
They whipped him in the shape and ifs been so 
much better. Oh. 
Sorry, flush rt for a second. 
It's been so much better and now we have like, 
we·re working with some of the people on 
activation to help us standardu:e. hke evffl mo--. 
like. 
So it it's been, it's been nighl and day between 
2023 and 2025, 
.._ 
AndrewRyan 2S:S1 
Nice.OK. 
u
=Piot
2S:51 
So yeal\ so this is pretty much what we're doing. 
This is like again like Kyle has been what what 
we've been doing is for the most part Kyle's been 
doing this hke by himself. 
I've been adding m stuff here and there, but since 
he came on, I've had him kind of take the reins on 
it and then I JUSl I JU St QA and approve hts hke he 
qa•s it after he's done. 
Then he lets me know that there's stuff that needs 
to go hve. 
And then he sends 11 my way to, like, approve and 
give him the OK lo push live. and then he'll put It 
in the. hke, live. 
He'll like. JUSt copy h,s. 
His changes and add It to the the hve. 
Calculated d1menS10n. So the one that does not 
have Dev or Rhode Island In front of ,t. 
Most of these kind of look the same as some are 
referencing other things. 
Let's look at campaign branding. 
So thts one Is Just deterrn1mng 1f the campaign ts 
branded or Ullbranded. So as you can see, agam a 
lot of ovemdes here probably shouldn't have been 
done at the top. 
But. 
Mostly these are Just campaign names. 
And they're Just saying, ,f the campaign name Is 
this, this equals branded. If the campaign name 
equals this, this Is unbranded. 


We've been. we had them dean this up too 
recentty, so we had a hard time with ~pie like 
actually selecting branded, unbranded. right or hli:e 
not calling things hke unbranded and JUSt like 
putting m the unbranded name without like it's 
saying that. 
For 2025. we started having them. 
When? 
When they're selecting things. 
ln the system. espec1alty for hke. 
Search and 50Cial they onty t\ave the ability hke 
when they're creatmg campaign or account names 
to select. 
,~. 
They were. 
A while back they wei--e doing e1thei-- DSC or DSA 
So they're the same th,ng. One Is Just d isease state 
awareness. The other one 1s disease slate 
eduC<1t1on. 
And we were hke, stop selecting 1. 
Just pick one. So we like clean that up for them 
and we're like hey, JUSI use DSC. 
Dse hke moving fo1Ward JUSt so we can be hke DSE. 
is on branded 
But yeah. I think that 
I think the best way to learn this JS really 1f I give 
you the list of all the ones we're using, what we're 
using them for, Just taking a look at the the current 
express10ns and Just seemg 1f you unlike kind of 
read ttv-ough them and tf. 
There's any type of code that's 1n here that you 
don't completely understand. Just hke Googhng rt 
and like wnl1ng 11 down. ttwirs pretty much what 
What I ended up domg with these. 
And thefl let me show you how hke I th1nlc 
someth1n9 that you'll and thJS rs something we 
were talking about with data bncks like geltlng 
into data bncks. So bas1eally let me let me show 
you. 
let me go to the document first. 
So I created t h1S. 
like kind of d1ct10nary because I kept telling Jackie 
like 1 don't necessanly know. 
What these do? 
like with the current names that are listed m. 
The data Rama. 
So I went in. 
And is this the? 
Is that's the one. 
No. 
0~ 
So bas1eally what I did IS I took all of the dev 
rn.nnels with their ltke ex upression example at 
that time and then I JUSt ksted what 11 does. 
So rm hke thrs dev. This ape• and pmx partners. 
This dasslfies rf the media was bought through 
Ape11: Prm or active versus 1t. 
I don't know why rt doesn't have rts own part why 
rt's not JU!>! part of all the other partner 
But it's ~parate. 
This one aud1eoce classifies whether the brand Is 
HTP or OTC brand mani:et name classifieds. the 
name of the brand as It eK1sts m market. 
Plus. the brand report name classifieds. the name 
of the brand that gets used for the report name. 
So it Just goes through and Just tells you what it's 
being used what ii does. 
Lilce what it's bemg used for, and then 1 made a hst 
of like best ways to hke QA. I.Jke lf you 1f you make 
an update. 
In the class1ficat10n where you should like QA. 
Against 
To malce sure that 11 worked and that ,t didn't 
impact anything else. 
I put some other rules here and then I put no1es 
like wheo thlS hke IS needed the most. 
So !Ike the brand market name 1s needed when 
OOnchmg a new brand. 
&and report name 1s needed for launching a nev,, 
braad. 
We need to nollfy NoYarti.s. 
lfwe like add something there so II.Just grves like a 
bunch of roles. 
On like when th,ngs are updated, I have a couple 
other rules where I was like. please don't update It 
unless 1t's requested by either Jackie or Rachel. 
Final update 1s typically me and not Jackie. but hlce 
it's Just certain fields that are !1ke more sens1trve 
than others. 
So like the ICM ones. clearly hke there's a lot of 
eyes on Ipmm. So we don't wanna update these 
unless either like somebody hlce hke myself. 
Offered ape for plastic.

It's some land of Novartis made-up ........ name. 
•• And,,_ Ryan 33:22 
OK. got you. 


g ......... »<> 
Yeah. So yeah, so. 
We have this and then, so I'll send this to you so 
you can you can have that. 
There's also like. 
I think I don"t know who made this one. 
This might have been Jackie. 
I'll send you this one too. 
Couple it's got a little bit more built built out 
notes. Here are the definit ion. 
And t hen 
Let me show you what the QA looks like that we've 
been doing. 
'Cause this is t he I think the bread and butter and 
the important part. That's riot it. 
Tum on your things open. 
Alright Yes, yes, ye-s, OK. 
0~ 
So typically we·re getting classification updates. If 
like somebody on N2 is asking for it during our like 
monthly reporting cycle. So like they might catch 
something isn't being like is coming in wrong 
coming in then under the wrong like brand or they 
might say it's missing but. 
It's actually just under the wrong brand. 
Um. 
No11artis sometimes asks us to reclassify something 
if they think that it is incorrect. 
Jackie will ask us to reclassify if we're cleaning up 
something that she has like mandated. 
But basically anytime like we're making these 
updates. 
We're typically doing a a weekly clas.sification QA 
regardless. 
So like whether we have 100 updates in a week or 
like 1 update in a week. we do a weekly 
classification. 
In QA so 
Where we do that to t rack and re..:tify issues like 
errors and issues and like the classificat ions that 
we made. 
This is j ust listing out how Lake Novartis is 
currently constantly looking at the data which is 
why we have to like stay on lop of t his. 
And then again times we update our classification. 
So again. if we identify an issue in the QA process. 
if Novartis t ickets us an is.sue that's directly tied to 
classifications. or if our internal teams ticket us an 
issue that's directly t ied to classifications. 
And then if we are launching a new brand or 
indication. we need to do classifications. 
Again. 
We're using pretty much the dev and the 
production en11ironment for this. 
So we make our edits in the de11 first We then QA 
it and make sure everything looks good 
It d idn't impact anything else. 
And t hen we mo11e 11 to five. 
In Jira. So this Is a basically an ongoing picket in 
JIRA and t hen Kyle just creates a sub task every 
week and it pulls in this like checklist that he can 
that he can do like where these are all the checks 
that he has to do. 
Every every week. 
And then he will attach like his hke file. If he's 
made any update he has like. 
He'll attach t he file to JIRA and then if he's made 
any updates, there is a log on box. 
He'll put the das.sification updates he made on in 
that log and then QA within the log and t hen give 
him approval. 
So the log pretty much just looks like 
It's just like an ongoing. 
Like. No. he'll like, make a note for e11ery week and 
then he will drop all the classification changes. 
That he made in here and I'll go line by line. 
And QA and myself. 
And then I'll approve it 
I approve line by line, so some of them I'll be like 
green approved red. 
Please revise this. 
And t hen push live and then yellow is a hold. 
And the whole usually just means bring that into 
next week. 
Document because we can't. 
We can't push it this week and then once I do that. 
l'H check this box and then I'll check this box when 
he pushes e11erything live 
So we do this every week. We have a classification 
meeting on Thursdays and then we have our one 
on ones on Thursday. 
So we'll do some if we have classificat ion questions 
for Jackie, we'll ask them in the classification 
meeting with her an.cl then if there's anything 
outstanding from that meeting or anything 
outstanding for that he"s done that week. we'll talk 
about it in our one-on-one and then he. 
Push live. 
These are kind of like the full steps that everything 
goes through. so I've been pushing that. We only 
do production pushes two days a week because 
it's easier to track if something went wrong versus 
like pushing whenever during t he week. 
So I've settled right now on. 
Unless it's a true emergency of somet hing that 
needs to be like an ad hoc push. we"re only 
pushing on Thursdays and Mondays. 
With the idea that. like Thursday. is our main days 
and then if there's anything urgent or anything 
t hat had to be reviewed on Thursday and could 
not be pushed. we could review on Friday or 
Monday and then push any outstanding items 
from the pre11ious week or Monday. 
And t hen do it all again on Thursday for anything

If everything 1s good, then the approved changH

We re.illy need to set up something where the 
.ipproved changes are bem9 reviewed and a 
c1ilss1fiut1on report. This is part of what? 
A pro,ect that I had mentioned 1bol.it data Brok. so 
l'U get to that shortly and then once the apf)(owd

Soletmegobad.'.. 
Let me go to the 21st'°' 
We had a lot of this stutt-·r• dou<tg nght now. 
WNch IS why II Hems ht. it's a lot IS ~ly ipmm 
dean up. 
So ,rs stuff that -
either didn't catch 1n the past 
or things -
reahzed that w• ~ 
to blKtet 1 
httle d1ffer@ntly for ,pmm. 
So here's a perfect example. 
The week of Apnl 21st. 
We had 
Just three things. 
Th.it needed to occur. 
We had to hard code an MOM MO Edge paduige 
to be MO Edge Fronthne, so quick update to one 
package within the u,mpaign. 
We had a MW Rebbe branded campaign stan that 
was showing up as not ctau,fied. so Kyle u,me ,n 
and j.ist added the daulf1C1t10n fOf ,t 
Whdactually7 
l"lgetbKkontNs. 
I think he rMSSed rt up. so I am gonna have to 
have him update that ~ 
1h11 tnlue lhould 
Re branded. rt should n....t JUSI been the Remt 
becaust' there·s a ditfet'enl fiekl tMt tak.s care of 
the branded. 
So now 11 likely there rt·s I good chine• th11 IS 
likely saying R.m1 branded brand ,t when 
everything gets put together. 
So gonna have, to check that out and then we had 
an mdicat10n chang1. 
So we had gotten a request. 
To from paid search speaf1CaUy !hit w• netd«I to 
break out some of the 1nd1ca11ons, they w•r• lcind 


Is a pam m the ... '°'1'1et1mH. 1nd they l!l(e buckel 
a bunch of their 1ndia110ns mto one like 
advertiser, which they shcx.lldn·t do 1nd they know 
that by now. 
But they had a lot of turnc,,,;er and tMy ended up 
budetJng llke a bunch of inclabons into one. 
_ 
Andr-Ry.-. 44t9 
OK. 
~Jt,ot4,t.l] 
One c.amp~ngn ~ 
In search fo, WNlt -
hMi to do was 11.m go 
through and ltke. make a bunch of updates so lhM 
rfs 5')1rt OU! the tndlGlllOn. 
So dunng the week of Apnl 21st. there were there 
wn only three updates that occurrtd. 1nd 1h1f1 
hke typical hke, it's bke somewhere between like 1 
couple. hke a handful of up<btes and they're small. 
-. Andrew Ry11n 44:40 
OK.nght. 
() =..:rthe::kage rtl.attd Of they're I sp«:rfic 
brand within a ct..nMI rtl.attd. 
It's not like a lot of again ov.rarchmg stuff 
The reason why this OM so long IS bKMJM bd'Je's 
been wor'ong with the actMtJOn teams to drt1n up 
someold@f"dass.ttic.atlOnS bK.luw. 
Ounng the lpmm cycle. they're t)'PIGIII), loobng at 
realty wonky date~ 
So IOStead of hke a normal thing where you would 
look at the annual ngh1? 
I.Jke ,f we·re 11'1 the middle of 2025 i•e I would 
They would probably look 11 something tot- !he 
~ 
like year. so hke >une 202-4 to loke M1y 2025 or 
June 2025. 
Nowthey"re looking II like December 1st. 2023. 
To may. 
May 3ht. 2025. 
So Jackie has been going crazy trying to clean up 
old data that mtght have been m1sstd or might 
have been buckete<I • little differently thlt maybe 
caused a lot of ques11ons the last cycle and trying 
to get ahead of th.al. So that ts why there's so 
many, nght. 
Now. because she's playing dun. wtl.l. we're doing 
all of this. 
She's~ dean up tot- thll cyde thafs coming 
up. 
So, lotof thestuffyou'I IN Jacb.-S ~ 
lpmm Mid I tokt ~ 
to plNi.. kite. put WMfe this 
like request is stemming from beause for I whd11 
hew.n,ust putting the updates and rm like. I don't 
unclem.Jnd why we re INbng thrl update 
He·s been trying to leavt I little btl dl!ane, notn

being asked beQuse the tpmm or thtl IS com1nq 
out of the tdet that we were requesting so. 
It does shift week to Wffk. bu! door nght before 
1pm, 
Tht:>$e class1fiaibon logs and to get longer. 
Yeah. lhafs • good question. ·cause. wt wt realty 
sh01.1ldn't be seeing a wholt slew of updates unless 
there's something hke, like you 111d, l1k.e e1th•r 
we're launching something Mw or somebody 
caught something in the duhbo1rd that's like this 
1swrong. 
It $hould have been bfolten out hke this. and then 
we have to talk to them and be ~k•. 1s this an US 
issue or d,d you actr,,,1111 this wrong and then we 
have to~ Iha! COflVffSIIJOn? 
So. 
It does ltke ~t I htde Ide:._ )'OU know. II some

We've~ mistlf:es ,n the past. so we'W .JU51 
..... """"' ....... 
I.Jke I I left a whcH note. 
I made, whofe note a~ ago for tha on. 
No. 
Nope. 
I can't find It, but 11 WH ~51C1lly ltke I~ high 
level ofhke. 
Don't thmk btg. think smaN. 
Don't try to hke reinvent the wheel. 
Just keep the hke. keep the veh1clt moving, 
basically. 
For now and hk.e. 
Like as a reminder hke this does ,mpact stuff across 
like whatever upd,tes you·re making currently will 
1mpitd: things. 
Like all the 1Jm11. 
That like from like I guess like we start~ us,ng 
data ~ma 1n llkll 2020-2021 
So whatever updates you're malon;, lhe W"6f !hat

that it does have to be like tru11 SQL and not 1h1s

Kind of sequel kind of hke J Quel a hnle b11 hke ifs

Andrew RyM 49-.26 
Yeah. 
~Piot 49-30 
So like. thafs going to be the one thmg 1s we're 
gomg to have to. we're going to have to convert. 
Every do use some of the on91nal code m.

just gonna have to convert 
The notebook ,n l,ke we·re going to have to do hne

But we have people here that know how to do

And irll be a good learning e)(perience. I know for

Rache!Plot 50:08 
Umm. 
Cool. So I thmk that's all I'm goma go over today. 
I know we have a part I'm gonna set up a Part 2. 
Part 2 IS JUSt gonna go through the actual data 
report. 
So that's the report. that rf you make an update. 
To a daSS1fic.atlon like and I've told Kyte this too, 
and I know he hates the report. 
I know he hates the report. 
I know the dasslficat1on QA nght now 1s very 
manual but we can't I told him before like. 
We can't. If you make an update to a dev field, you 
can't JUSI pull in that dev field 1n a ptvot to see ,f 1t 
changed. 
Like you're isolatmg. 
Just to that dimension that you changed or that 
calculate dimens10n that you change not thmkmg 
about if that dimension impacts other dimensions. 
So thars why we have to really look at the full data 
report. 
To see 1f any of the update we made negatively 
impacted any of the other like d1mens10ns we have 
set up that ties to that spec,fk hke med,a hke. 
That that placeml!flt or that package. So we'll go 
over that a l1nle bit more dunng Pan 2. I think 
once you see the beta report. a lot of stuff. I lrke 
looking at the beta beause it's massive. 
But 1t really just shows you ~ke we·s 1h15 padcage 
or this plac'ement and this 15 how this enllfe thing 
is being dass1fied ~ss every. 
Calculated d1men5'0n that we have. 
And it's JU St all m one Ucel report 
And that's the thing that I look at when I'm QA ING 
the the updates that Kyle made. 
That's <1lso the thing that I would love to try to get 
Where we can have baby data brldts look.mg at the 
Excel. 
And kind of runn+ng true faucets on 11 by itself. 
Like daily so that we can be alerted 1f something 1s 
looking wonky from a class1ficat1on standpoint. 
So that it's not as much onus on us to do like 
manually. 
Do you have any questions nght now? 
I know ifs a lot of mformat1on.. 
., Andrew Ryan 
52,48 
Not really. 
I don't know. 
I w<1s getting a little nervous fOf this~ but dws 
hke reading through rt land of makes more sense 
to me than I was expectmg. 
11 me<1n. of courw. bke knowing when to do 11 and 
gettmg hke ~nds on 1h1s report. 
I'm not gonna s1I down and crush tl bul ltke I 
understilnd the purpose of rt. 
.A.nd hke wtiat rt's actually do,ng. 
In the back and that automation thing. we actually 
work with Esteban on something s1m1lar to that. 
domg automating one of the qa's and we both 
took the same Python course a few months ago . 
.A.nd we did find a way to do 1t using pandas 1n 
Python. 
That worked pretty well and I hope that maybe we 
can do something similar here 
u ::.::th:::utd be awHOme. 
Yeah. So once we, I know nght now Kyle is JU St 
trying to is working with Joe on eng1neenng JUSI to 
try to get the report from the OATARAMA 10 
export and like ingest mto d.ita bncks.. 
I th1nk they had to hke look at hke going thtough 
BLOB for il But once he does that we can actually 
.... 
The the like data repotl mformation delivered to 
data. 
I figured you can kind of take the ball on that and 
try to statl budding out something .

(J :: 
:e :
: mg about ~st we~ 
With Novartis. 
Wedo. 
X 
A lot of work to da=fy the data that we're gettmg. 
And all the different channels m the Novartis. MCI, 
Again. the one that has, like the big Novartis name 
on 1t aod the Salesforce logo on t~ nght side, we 
do classifications here and I think rt's important to 
know like h1storicals here because like I think it'll 
make a lo1 more sense about why. 
I this is gomg to seem a hltle C'Oflvoluled. 
Basically. 
In the past we've done this here because I r m 
under the assumption we did this tier because of 
the fact that we did not ~ 
Super Strong SOL coding. People oo the account 
so it's a lot easier to write like. 
Data Rama based SOL in Datarama itself and I also 
think that the people in the account at the time so 
like facl::ie and DaVJd Haberman and a few other 
people, they were really expenenced 1n data Rama 
speofically. 
So I think II was JUSt like low hanging fruit like lef s 
JUSt put thcs in here. 
We know how to use rt. 
We koow how to wnte 1t 
Will JUSt WIii JUSI dump it here. 
Fast forward. 
Like 5-6 years la1er, th1s 1s not the best platf0<m to 
do this m like I've been working in thts for \tke 8 
months and you can JU st see that this is not the 
best place to do this in to the scale that we are 
domg 1t 
Data Rama is not scalable so l know we've talked 
about th1S a few times. 
like, th.ifs like the best part about havtng a date 
of birth sound hke a snowflake 1s at their scalable. 
So if something's slow, you can make rt faster. You 
can't do that with data Rama. So the more you add 
m here. the more 11 slows everything down. 
So. 
ti's it's goUen to be a beast and I'm going to s~ 
you this because we are st1I operating business as 
usual. 
For a Novartis, by doing the dass1f1Cab0ns in 
Datorama. However, we've been talking with. 
I talked with Chns and Kyle about rt a couple 
months ago and I was hke. rt does not make .sense 
to have this year. 
Where can we do classifications that would make 
sense? 
Do we do this in Soowflake and after talking and 
having like kind of Just a bramstormmg session. 
we're like all every dtent at PHM. 
Uses date of births. so we should probably do 
classifications 1n data brides. because then 1f we 
onboard a new. 
Client we can just copy and paste like date of 
birth's notebooks hke into a new chent instance 
and data and data bf1cks and then people could 
Just ed,t those workbooks like as they need 11 and 
instead of having a copy and paste eve,y single 
thmg that we. 
Set up in MCI and do screen shares. 
And have access issues and ,I'll Just take a lot less 
time to ooboard a client but rt's also a better place 
to do 11 ,n because agam it's scalable. 
So for now. we·re still domg this the way the o ld 
way 1s. What I hke to call it. 
In the Novartis MCL we're gonna, we·re having 
GSK. 
Test out bu1ld1ngs out classrfications m databncks 
to see if we can test the functionality like Novartis 
,s not the client. 
To do that on and then if everything is going 
according to plan. we're going at some point to 
port evetyth1ng that we've done in dmnerama over 
to data PERC. 
One other h1s1oncal note here rs that lhe reason 
why these are so conduded aod so long and so 
complex IS because of the h1slory of, hke bad 
activation. bad taxonomy, bad, like not following 
the rules. not doing 0A like all the things that 
should have been happening just. 
Not happening. 
So there's a lot of stuff 1n here 
That 1s was created based on cleaning up. 
Bad taxonomy and bad data.. 
We're 1n a better spot now, so a lot of that stuff is 
no longer like needed for current day data, but we 
have to leave 11 there because ,f somebody deades 
they wanna pull hl::e four yea~ worth of data we 
still need that The older stuff to Just 
Be clean and like show the '!iilme hke be

So that being said. that I why I hall this,, ~H 1t

The best w.ay I an dHcnbe ll IS th.at. 
Like question ewrythlng.

So they typee.ally bombard us w,th qu1'$1JOnS. 
They're co~ntly puling flf)CIIU'9 during that

O<. 
o::;:,:~ 
So yeah. hopefully .aft-. probably August. w1·11 
start movmg stuff over. 
We'll see how GSK IS going. 
We'll see 1f we can. 
They basically use som1 of lhe code th•t WI like. 
Kyle's been helpmg !hem out• ht1l1 b11 with both 
their hke datarc1ma build a,nd their databricks build. 
So he's been kind of copy •nd pas11ng som1 of the 
baseline code that we have •nd they've bffn 
tr.Jnslilt1ng 1t lo SOL And then •k• dear11ng rt up 
and making rt what he wai tl)'lng to do. 
lnthefnt plK• in ro ours.. he IS now lt')'lngtodo 
with them ro 1n. lib databnc:b and whatnol So. 
O<. 
Sothais.aloflhldasslfK..at,onthat-..dofot lhl 
data are in the CMaJUlted ckrMnslon5 filld. And as 
I was saying the odwr day. rm p,obabfy90f'M\.I 
come in and add Nlat lhlat the Ind or the 
begmn,ng of aH of t~ so that. 
We can ~rs,, out ou" beause they thef•·s • 
bunch of stuff ,n her• that thal 1sn·1 ours a,nd 
there's a bunch of stuff that is, but 11'1 hard to tell 
what IS whal so. 
I do have a 11st of things like. Typic•lly if something 
So that's how you 1h1fs hke 1n HS)' way off th• 
bat to see like what we're doing versus what 
somebody else 1s doing 


Not everyone has a dev, so that's why I'm hke, we 
do have to get this cleaned up a htt1e bit 
·cause it's it's a little hard to naV19ate. 
But as you can see we h.ave hke different. 
.. Andrew Ryan 10:27

And there we go.

Alnght now we'r@ cru,smg. 
~Piot 10:,40 
Oil 
So agam. bke thlS IS really difficult to get through. 
So. 
They If you 1oc::. for somebody that has a dev. ,r s 
ours. but not everything has a dev. 
So that's why I'm like we have to come m here and 
clean it up because ,rs it's h.ard to tell what IS ours 
and whatnot 
But 
As you can see. we have qurt.e a few dasstficahons 
that we're doing. 
And I hallt' a document on box that I can send you 
that kmd of h5ts out. What all of these d1mens1ons 
are hke? 
What all of these hke mean? 
Like what? They what? They tie back to? 
Until you get hke a little used to like what each one 
does. I think the ones that were typically m the 
most tend to be like very hkeJUSI the brand name 
like making sure the brand names nght making 
sure the mdicat!Oll is nght. 
Makmg sure the audience Is nght that it's HTP or 
OTC. 
Malong sure the pramc Is nght. 
Is It branded or unbranded so? 
We typically use hke a lot of same ones 011er and 
over and OW1' again. but rH send you that or I'll 
pul up the document ma little btt. 
So you can see hke what what IS what. 
Well r m gonna happen to ,ust one that we use 
frequently. 
ti's brand report name. 
So this ts what I1 loob like when you come m here 
and the code Is at the bottom so you can make ti 
full screen. 
What you could do too is like sometimes like I'll 
copy and paste this out of here and put rt m like a 
OneNote. 
To manipulate some stuff. 
But as long as you're working m dev like what I 
suggest 1s 1f you're playing around a dev, Just copy 
and paste the code that's currently m !here before 
you start like. 
Doing stuff and then you can hke make edtts and 
dev as you need. 
It's not gonna impact anything that hke N011artts ts 
looking at bot as long as hke we have the prev1ous 
code m case there's like a maJor issue that we can't 
fix. we Just bnng the old code l»clt. 
So basically at the top IS ,ust going to be all of the 
like references. 
So like what this code Is going to be referenang 
and pu1hng m? 
So rf you JUSI like type m like. 
Vanable and then whatever you want lo ull 
something. 
So like say I want to bfmg In a partner, l'd be M;e 
p.irtner or hke part equals and then once you. 
See the brackets.. 
You can type In any of the dimens10ns that we 
currently hallt' in Met and find 11 and then. That 
way when you go to write your code, all you have 
to do is wnte partner or part and then 11 will pull 
fromthal 
Dimension that currently exists m order to make a 
ca(cutated dimension. 
So like 1f I wanted to do partner, I would probably 
look for partner. 
Umm. 
There's also hke drfferent Immermns I like. 
I would suggest uS1ng the regular partner field. 
That's like already made m here versus there any of 
the re1mmernons. I would only use the 
reImmersK>nS for like ~ually like pulling reports 
on the analyze and~ tab. 
But yeah you could. 
Just like add m the partner and then I could start 
Wfitmg code that bnngs In the panner 1f 1f I 
needed to. 
So that's all that this like all that. this sKtton rs 
doing is JUSl. 
Adding m. 
All of the dimensions we're 90mg to be usmg m 
order to create a new dimension and then Just 
some substitutions. 
So again, I'm not the best coder. 


So like I typiully when I tint startad do11"19 this. I 
would JU51 come m here and I would JUSt try to 
chKt out like. wtat ts gomg on. If there wu 
something that I dldn I rKOgnlM, hie• I dldnl 
know the length codM before. 
Or the length. 
I dtdnl lcnow the coal Ins so. I would }Ult bk.e 
Google and be hte. what does this do7 
l.oolr: for the mo5t JM11. 
We're not wnllng anything like net new in here 
We're JI.Isl like If there IS• new lf'IStanc:e of 
somethng that nHds to be dH.Slfied I d,fffflf'lt 
W<Jy. 
We're JUst cunently kind of hke m1rronng whit 
<Jlre<J<fyexistmhef'e. 
So <J lot of this stuff like. 1911n this 1s for Brand 
rl:'portnoilme. 
So we're trying to crHte I clun report name. 
So a couple llke one that ,s. 
Like you could do here. 
Right. Like so this one ts rf brand equals V Joyce 
and lhl:'fl the camp11gn also contains Ludo, whic:h 
used to be like the old code for B Joyce. 
The new brand name 1s 90m9 to be ludath.arl. 
So this IS what's going 10 show WM0 you pull In 
Brand repon ~me and thrs ,s how hb the 
umpaigns are gomg to be aggrt91ted under. 
~rcDess of WNt they hive m the NAV, joyce or 
the umpaign name of loud.

like completely butchered Remy this Rtmy. 
•• Andrew Ryan 1634 
Mm hmm. 
~Ptot 1fr.JS 
I doo't eYefl know how to say 11. 
Somebody butchefed It. When they when they 
made a name. 
So rt was probably corning m all wonky ., our 
reportwlg. So somebody dlsslfied 11 as Wte If brMld 
equak Remy. what- the, thre butchered l'\lfM Of 
thebrandequab. 
~ 
is the actua' spelling of the name for brand

Some people wtf"e shortening rt or br;and equ,ls. I 
guess somebody butdwrad one of the other ones. 
but then? 
.._ 
And,,_ Rpn 17:0S 
OK. 
So you're pretty much hke loolc.,ng for 111 the

AndrewRyan 2S:S1 
Nice.OK. 
u
::Piot2S:51 
So yeah. so this is pretty much what we're doing. 
This is like again like Kyle has been what what 
we've been doing is for the most part Kyle's been 
doing this like by himself. 
I've been adding m stuff here and there, but since 
he came on, I've had him k,nd of take the reins on 
it and then I JUSl I JU St QA and approve his hke he 
qa•s it after he's done. 
Then he lets me know that there's stuff that needs 
to go hve. 
And then he sends 11 my way to, like, approve and 
give him the OK lo push live, and then he'll put It 
in the.like, live. 
He'll like. JUSt copy h,s. 
His changes and add It to the the hve. 
Calculated dImen:won. So the one that does not 
have Dev or Rhode Island In front of 11. 
Most of these kind of look the same as some are 
referenang other things. 
Let's look at campaign branding. 
So this one Is Just determ1mng 1f the campaign IS 
branded or Ullbranded. So as you can see, agam a 
lot of ovemdes here probably shouldn't have been 
done at the top. 
But. 
Mostly these are Just campaign names. 
And they're Just saying. ,f the campaign name Is 
this, this equals branded. If the campaign name 
equals this, this Is unbranded. 


We've been. we had them dean this up too 
recentty, so we had a hard time with ~pie like 
actually selecting branded, unbranded. right or hli:e 
not calling things hke unbranded and JUSt like 
putting m the unbranded name without like it's 
saying that. 
For 2025. we started having them. 
When? 
When they're selecting things. 
ln the system. espec1alty for hke. 
Search and 50Cial they onty t\ave the ability hke 
when they're creatmg campaign or account names 
to select. 
,~. 
They were. 
A while back they wei--e doing e1t hei-- DSC or DSA 
So they're the same th,ng. One Is Just d isease state 
awareness. The other one 1s d isease slate 
eduC<1t1on. 
And we were hke, stop selecting 1. 
Just pick one. So we like clean that up for them 
and we're like hey, JUSI use DSC. 
Dse hke moving fo1Ward JUSt so we can be hke DSE. 
is on branded 
But yeah. I think that 
I think the best way to learn this JS really 1f I give 
you the list of all the ones we're using, what we're 
using them for, Just taking a look at the the current 
express10ns and Just seemg 1f you unlike kind of 
read ttv-ough them and tf. 
There's any type of code that's 1n here that you 
don't completely understand. Just hke Googhng rt 
and like wnl1ng 11 down. ttwirs pretty much what 
What I ended up domg with these. 
And thefl let me show you how hke I th1nlc 
someth1n9 that you'll and thJS rs something we 
were talking about with data bncks like geltlng 
into data bncks. So bas1eally let me let me show 
you. 
let me go to the document first. 
So I created t h1S. 
like kind of d1ct10nary because I kept telling Jackie 
like 1 don't necessanly know. 
What these do? 
like with the current names that are listed m. 
The data Rama. 
So I went in. 
And is this the? 
Is that's the one. 
No. 
0~ 
So bas1eally what I did IS I took all of the dev 
rn.nnels with their ltke ex upression example at 
that time and then I JUSt ksted what 11 does. 
So rm hke thrs dev. This ape• and pmx partners. 
This dasslfies rf the media was bought through 
Ape11: Prm or active versus 1t. 
I don't know why rt doesn't have rts own part why 
rt's not JU!>! part of all the other partner 
But it's ~parate. 
This one aud1eoce classifies whether the brand Is 
HTP or OTC brand mani:et name classifieds. the 
name of the brand as It eK1sts m market. 
Plus. the brand report name classifieds. the name 
of the brand that gets used for the report name. 
So it Just goes through and Just tells you what it's 
being used what ii does. 
Lilce what it's bemg used for, and then 1 made a hst 
of like best ways to hke QA. I.Jke lf you 1f you make 
an update. 
In the class1ficat10n where you should like QA. 
Against 
To malce sure that 11 worked and that ,t didn't 
impact anything else. 
I put some other rules here and then I put no1es 
like wheo thlS hke IS needed the most. 
So !Ike the brand market name 1s needed when 
OOnchmg a new brand. 
&and report name 1s needed for launching a nev,, 
braad. 
We need to nollfy NoYarti.s. 
lfwe like add something there so II.Just grves like a 
bunch of roles. 
On like when th,ngs are updated, I have a couple 
other rules where I was like. please don't update It 
unless 1t's requested by either Jackie or Rachel. 
Final update 1s typically me and not Jackie. but hlce 
it's Just certain fields that are !1ke more sens1trve 
than others. 
So like the ICM ones. clearly hke there's a lot of 
eyes on Ipmm. So we don't wanna update these 
unless etther like somebody hlce hke myself. 
Offered ape for plastic.

Just 1mportant. 
~ =: 
1::~~'veah. 1t'SJUSI 1mponant. 
I don't. 
11 forget what It IS. 
It's some kmd of Novartis made-up ........ name. 
•• 
Andriew Ryan 
13:22 
OK. got you. 


g ......... »<> 
Yeah. So yeah, so. 
We have this and then, so I'll send this to you so 
you can you can have that. 
There's also like. 
I think I don"t know who made this one. 
This might have been Jackie. 
I'll send you this one too. 
Couple it's got a little bit more built built out 
notes. Here are the definition. 
And then 
Let me show you what the QA looks like that we've 
been doing. 
'Cause this is t he I think the bread and butter and 
the important part. That's riot it. 
Tum on your things open. 
Alright Yes, yes, ye-s, OK. 
0~ 
So typically we·re getting classification updates. If 
like somebody on N2 is asking for it during our like 
monthly reporting cycle. So like they might catch 
something isn't being like is coming in wrong 
coming in then under the wrong like brand or they 
might say it's missing but. 
It's actually just under the wrong brand. 
Um. 
No11artis sometimes asks us to reclassify something 
if they think that it is incorrect. 
Jackie will ask us to reclassify if we're cleaning up 
something that she has like mandated. 
But basically anytime like we're making these 
updates. 
We're typically doing a a weekly clas.sification QA 
regardless. 
So like whether we have 100 updates in a week or 
like 1 update in a week. we do a weekly 
classification. 
In QA so 
Where we do that to t rack and re..:tify issues like 
errors and issues and like the classificat ions that 
we made. 
This is j ust listing out how Lake Novartis is 
currently constantly looking at the data which is 
why we have to like stay on lop of this. 
And then again times we update our classification. 
So again. if we identify an issue in the QA process. 
if Novartis t ickets us an is.sue that's directly tied to 
classifications. or if our internal teams ticket us an 
issue that's directly t ied to classifications. 
And then if we are launching a new brand or 
indication. we need to do classifications. 
Again. 
We're using pretty much the dev and the 
production en11ironment for this. 
So we make our edits in the de11 first We then QA 
it and make sure everything looks good 
It didn't impact anything else. 
And t hen we mo11e 11 to five. 
In Jira. So this Is a basically an ongoing picket in 
JIRA and t hen Kyle just creates a sub task every 
week and it pulls in this like checklist that he can 
that he can do like where these are all the checks 
that he has to do. 
Every every week. 
And then he will attach like his hke file. If he's 
made any update he has like. 
He'll attach t he file to JIRA and then if he's made 
any updates, there is a log on box. 
He'll put the das.sification updates he made on in 
that log and then QA within the log and then give 
him approval. 
So the log pretty much just looks like 
It's just like an ongoing. 
Like. No. he'll like, make a note for e11ery week and 
then he will drop all the classification changes. 
That he made in here and I'll go line by line. 
And QA and myself. 
And then I'll approve it 
I approve line by line, so some of them I'll be like 
green approved red. 
Please revise this. 
And t hen push live and then yellow is a hold. 
And the whole usually just means bring that into 
next week. 
Document because we can't. 
We can't push it this week and then once I do that. 
l'H check this box and then I'll check this box when 
he pushes e11erything live 
So we do this every week. We have a classification 
meeting on Thursdays and then we have our one 
on ones on Thursday. 
So we'll do some if we have classificat ion questions 
for Jackie, we'll ask them in the classification 
meeting with her an.cl then if there's anything 
outstanding from that meeting or anything 
outstanding for that he"s done that week. we'll talk 
about it in our one-on-one and then he. 
Push live. 
These are kind of like the full steps that everything 
goes through. so I've been pushing that. We only 
do production pushes two days a week because 
it's easier to track if something went wrong versus 
like pushing whenever during the week. 
So I've settled right now on. 
Unless it's a true emergency of somet hing that 
needs to be like an ad hoc push. we"re only 
pushing on Thursdays and Mondays. 
With the idea that. like Thursday. is our main days 
and then if there's anything urgent or anything 
that had to be reviewed on Thursday and could 
not be pushed. we could review on Friday or 
Monday and then push any outstanding items 
from the pre11ious week or Monday. 
And then do it all again on Thursday for anything 


So basically we either identify a ctass1fic.at10n 
update or Novartis tickets us for a classification 
update or our act1vat10n teams.. 
Take it us for something that results In a 
classrficabon update. We review the request. 
We make the updated. we make the updates ,n 
Dev. 
We, the pe<SOO who put put rt ,n Dev. 
Performs a QA on the update wrthtn our 
dassificaboo report. 
If the update passes QA. then the scnpt changes 
are documented withm the log on box manager. 
Reviews that log. and the beta report. 
And you know, basically QA themselves and then 
approve re)@Cted that person. approves and re.,KtS 
the updates. I do have here that 1f a reJectIon 
ocrurs then step one. 
Need to be revIstted. 
If everythmg is good, then the approved changes 
are then approved. Updates are then pushed 10 
production. 
We really need to set up something where the 
approved changes are being reviewed and a 
classification report This ,s pan of what? 
A pro)@Cl that I had mentioned about data Brok. so 
I'll get to that shortly and then once the approved 
changes. 
look good from our side. Theo the ticket submitter 
is notified and the ticket ,s closed. and then d 
somethmg was updated for brand report name or 
indicat10n. we need to let these we we need to let 
Novartis know that we made that update. 
Thafs like the fall life of the class,ficat>On updates. 
Yeah. so this ,s what we're doing. 
And then let me show so 11 ifs pretty much like 
watch and repeat every week. 
So every week Kyle IS making updates to 
classtflCilt,ons bitsed on what what Is needed that 
-·· 
Either somebody asked for it or we caught 
something m our class1flCilt1on QA that we do 
weekly. 
He makes the updates m Dev. 
I review them In Dev. 
We approve them or reJect them. They get pushed 
live and then everybody ts notified of It of what 
was updated. 
Any questions so far? 
_ 
Andr- Ryan ,1:40 
No. I don't lhmk so. 
I guess ,rs Just like rm ii httle surpnsed how you 
know that you shared ooe of Kyle's hlce box notes 
in there, and rt looked hke there were a lot of 
dassification updates and I'm JUSt like that many 
..,.,,,__. 
For like. 
_ 
AndrewRyan '2'°2 
It Just. I mean. I guess In my media tech brain. I'm 
like well, how often do you ltke new campa,gns 
really launch like and especially ones that would 
need to be reclassified. But so frequently JUSt kmd 
of surprises me and I guess l don't really 
understand how there. 
U
1tact1e1Piot,zm 
Uh huh. 
•• Andr-Ryan 4.2;16 
So many changes hke this compared to how often 
like new campaigns will actually launch. and I don't 
need to be reclassified. 
u
::Piot 42:19 
That's a greal questaon. 
Solet megobact.. 
let me go to the 21st so. 
We had a lot of th IS stuff we're dou-.g nght now. 
which is why it seems hke Irs a lot 1s actually ipmm 
clean up. 
So ifs stuff that we either didn't catch In the past 
or things we realized that we need to bucket a 
little differently for Ipmm. 
So here's a perfect example. 
The week of April 21st. 
We had. 
Just three things. 
That needed to ocrur 
We had to hard code an MOM MD Edge padcage 
to be MO Edge Frontline, so quick update to one 
package w1th1n the campaign. 
We had a new Rebbe branded campaign start that 
was s.howmg up as not classified.. so Kyle came m 
and }Ust added the classiflCilt10n fOf 11. 
Which actually? 
I'll get back on this. 
I th111k he messed it up. so I am gonna have to 
have him update that Basially this 11alue should 
not be. 
Re branded. 11 should have JUSI been the Rem, 
because lhere·s ii different field that takes care of 
the branded. 
So now 11 likely there ,rs a good chance thlS Is 
likely saying Remi branded brand 11 when 
everything gets put together. 
So gonna have to ched: that out and then we had 
an indication change. 
So we had gotten a request. 
To from paid search speaficatly that we needed to 
break out some of the ind1cat1ons. they were kmd 


ts a pam in the '" K>nMtlmti. and they ltke bucket 
a bunch of tMtr 1ncl,c.abonS mto one bli:e 
~rbsef. whtch they shouldn I do and they li:now 
that by now. 
But they had a lol of tumov« and they ended up 
bucbting hli:it a bunch of mdicallOnS into one. 
KK:he!Ptot 4'-ll 
One campa9n advertiser. 
In sear-ch fOf what -
had to do was JUSt go 
through .and hke. 1Mb a bunch of updates so that 
11 s 5f)lrt out the lndtabOn. 
So dunng thit WHlc of Apr,t 21st. th«ewefe th«it 
was only thrff ~tn thlt occurred, and that's 
ltke typical hke, ifs ilke 50fflewhere between hli:e 1 
couple, hli:e a handful of updates and they're small . 
._ 
And1ew Ry11n

OK. nghl. 
bet.el"°' 44.A7 
They're e,ther plCU9l' r.iated or they're a spec1f1C 
br.Jnd wrthm I ctwvw4 r.t,lled. 
It's not like a lot of aga,n owrMdwlg stuff. 
Tot! rHson why thr$ OM so long IS bec.luse Jldoe"s 
be@n WOBJng with the 1ctM11t10n teams to dean up 
Wm@ okleJ dusificat1om bec.luse. 
Ounng the lpmm ~. they're typically looking at 
really wonky date ranges. 
So instead of like a normal thmg whefe you ~ 
k>ok at the annual r9ht7 
Like 1f we·re in the middle of 2025 hke I would 
They would probK>ly look II something fof the 
past hla! year, so like June 2024 to like May 2025 or 
June 2025. 
Now they're looking at hke December 1st. 2023. 
To may. 
May31st.2025. 
So Jac:li:1e has been going crazy trying to dun up 
old data that might hive been missed or might 
have been bt.lcketed I httle d1ffeJently th■t maybe 
caused a 101 of quesllom the last cycle and trymg 
to get ahead of that. So that IS why there's so 
many, nghl 
Now. because w·s pla,ying dean. well. we're dolOljl

She's playng dNn up fof that cyde than com,ng

So a lot of the stuff you·1 see Jadoo reqUftt.

hke request IS stemming from beause for I whi. 
he wH Just putting the updates and rm hli:e. I don't

It does shift weet to WHt. but door nght before

Yeah, that's a 9()0d quest10n. 'c.aus.. -
~ 
really

basically. 
For now and hke. 
l,ke as a remmdeJ hke 1h1s does impact stuff across 
hli:e whatever updates you're making currently will 
1mpactth1ngs. 
Like al the llme. 
That like from like I gueu like Wt' starttd using 
data Rama m like 2020-2021 
So whatl!Yet' updates you're mal:Jng. the way that 
11·s currently 5et up. IS 11 117 It could impact 
5emething that was like ctassifllfd differently 1n 
2022. 
So that's why it's not. 11.'s not great. 
Sul we wtll try to again I lhmt Of1Ce we can stan 
getllng the dusificlt10ns out of thcs hlte teJnble 
system. 
Come mto data brlCk.s. 
We'I be abi. to 1Mke things Ilk• much more 
standarda.td and much more deaned up. 
We're slll gonna nffd OYel'ndes here and there. 
but II shouldn't be IS frequent. It should be hke 
minimal compartd to what we have 1n there now. 
Agam. the one the one thmg about data bncts 1s 
that 11 does have to be hke true SQL and not this 
like you know, 


Kind of sequel kind of hke J Quel a hnle b11 hke ifs 
its own. 
Ifs its own language. but using SQL based 
DATABRICKS does have to be bke traditional SQL 
.._ 
Andrew Ry1on 49-.26 
Yeah. 
ftachelPlot 49-30 
So like. thafs going to be the one thmg 1s we're 
gomg to have to. we're going to have to convert. 
Every do use some of the on91nal code m. 
Here to classify b19 mOV1ng fo,ward for 2025. we're 
just gonna have to convert 
The notebook ,n l,ke we·re going to have to do hne 
by line arld Just convert rt to like real SQL 
But we have people here that know how to do 
that. 
And irll be a good learning e)(perience. I know for 
like you and I who don't have as much like of that 
exper.ence, so . 
.._ 
Andrew Ryan 50:03 
Mm hmm. 
RachelPlot 50:08 
Umm. 
Cool. So I thmk that's all I'm goma go over today. 
I know we have a part I'm gonna set up a Part 2. 
Part 2 IS JUSt gonna go through the actual data 
report. 
So that's the report. that rf you make an update. 
To a daSS1fic.atlon like and I've told Kyte this too, 
and I know he hates the report. 
I know he hates the report. 
I know the dasslficat1on QA nght now 1s very 
manual but we can't I told him before like. 
We can't. If you make an update to a dev field, you 
can't JUSI pull in that dev field 1n a ptvot to see ,f 1t 
changed. 
Like you're isolatmg. 
Just to that dimension that you changed or that 
calculate dimens10n that you change not thmkmg 
about if that dimension impacts other dimensions. 
So thars why we have to really look at the full data 
report. 
To see 1f any of the update we made negatively 
impacted any of the other like d1mens10ns we have 
set up that ties to that spec,fk hke med,a hke. 
That that placeml!flt or that package. So we'll go 
over that a l1nle bit more dunng Pan 2. I think 
once you see the beta report. a lot of stuff. I lrke 
looking at the beta beause it's massive. 
But 1t really just shows you ~ke we·s 1h15 padcage 
or this plac'ement and this 15 how this enllfe thing 
is being dass1fied ~ss every. 
Calculated d1men5'0n that we have. 
And it's JU St all m one U cel report 
And that's the thing that I look at when I'm QA ING 
the the updates that Kyle made. 
That's <1lso the thing that I would love to try to get 
Where we can have baby data brldts look.mg at the 
Excel. 
And kind of runn+ng true faucets on 11 by itself. 
Like daily so that we can be alerted 1f something 1s 
looking wonky from a class1ficat1on standpoint. 
So that it's not as much onus on us to do like 
manually. 
Do you have any questions nght now? 
I know ifs a lot of mformat1on.. 
., Andrew Ryan 52:48 
Not really. 
I don't know. 
I was getting a little nervous fOf this ooe. but dws 
hke reading through rt kmd of makes more sense 
to me than I was expectmg. 
11 mean. of course. bke knowing when to do 11 and 
genmg like hilnds on this report. 
I'm not gonna sit down and crush tl, but ltke I 
understilnd the purpose of 1t. 
And like wtiat rt's actuaUy do,ng. 
In the back and that automation thing. we actually 
work with Esteban on something s1m1lar to that. 
domg automating one of the qa's and we both 
took the same Python course a few months ago. 
And we did find a way to do 1t using pandas 1n 
Python. 
That worked pretty well and I hope that maybe we 
can do something similar here 
u :
.::th:::utd be awHOme. 
Yeah. So once we, I know nght now Kyle is JU St 
trying to is working with Joe on eng1neenng JUSI to 
try to get the report from the OATARAMA 10 
export and like ingest mto d.ita bncks.. 
I th1nk they had to hke look at hke going thtough 
BLOB for il But once he does that we can actually 
.... 
The the like data repotl mformation delivered to 
data. 
I figured you can kind of take the ball on that and 
try to statl budding out something .

u ::::~pl:: c►.oo 
Or data correct. Yeah. once you. 
The paper. 
The 521 has to dear, yes. 
OK 
X 
Yeah. And then once that happens. you know. we'll 
submit that e-mail for access to data Rama. So it 
takes.. it takes awhile, OK. 
And t hen I know like. 
Normal in our data route that like in my connected 
mix I only have like a couple things. but I've seen in 
yours as a whole list. 
I know mine's still on t he PHM version, but is that 
supposed to look like that ? 
Yeah, 'cause, I thi nk Craig is like working on getting 
more licenses. 
So right now you have like. 
A different like tier access. yeah. 
OK. 
Yeah. Yep. 
Cool. OK. so. 
Calculate dimensions OK. 
So again. we're updating. we're aggregating and 
standardizing all of the names 
And t he calculated dimension section. like I said. I'll 
come in here and dean up the names so that you 
can tell what is something that we created versus 
what something that the bartis created. But once 
we make the updates 
The way that we QA is through a report t hat"s 
already set up. 
It nms once a day. but if you have to make an 
update you have to just run the report again, 
refresh It. 
So this report is under analyie and act under 
reports. 
And it's called the beta report. 
So you just type in beta and this is it. 
So it runs once a day. If you need to run it again. 
you ;ust click it and hit run now. 
But what you can do is I typically go into the 
history and I want to get the new one. 
So ifs loading for today"s and then I just want to 
make sure that rm pulling the most recent one. 
Sometimes it's like not in order. 
So just make sure It says the most recent date and 
t hen r m going to just download most recent one 
that ran. 
This thing IS huge. 
So 1t does take a little bit to open. It feels hke a 
really, really slow t raffic workbook. 
I asked the college. 
Oh OK. so I looked at It. yeah. 
Yeah, I know. 
I know it's huge. 
So that's why this is another reason why we want 
to we want to redo the classifications, right? 
So we don't have to took at 2023 and 2024. 
Where we can look at just 2025 onward and 
everything thaf s already been classified for 2023 
or 2424 just remains as is like. It's kind of like once 
we get past the data analysis cycle with Novartis. 
we kind of want to j ust 
Like close the book. 
Like we want to be like, OK. 
Nobody touch any of these ever again. 
Because t he analysis has already been done, this is 
what's been pulled 
This Is what it's been looked at on the viruses and 
so we want to just kind of like lock it up and then 
just move on. 
And look at the most recent time period of data. 
This might take a while because J also have 
probably 100 Excel files. 
Ohno. 
I cleared it out yeah. 
OK. cool. So you got to do that and then it takes a 
minute. But basically this is pulling in all the things 
that we want to look at. 
When we do make an update right now it's not 
showing the reimmersion fields. 
I really don't want to bog this down by adding it in 
right now when we're manually checking, but I 
think if we can get an automated process set up, I 
would like to have it pull in t he reimmersion fields 
and look al everything. 
To see if t here was an issue. 
So right now it's only looking at the dev in like the 
production fields or the live field 
But yeah, it's going to show you literally everything 
and ifs going to pull in. 
At least it's going to pull in every placement that at 
least has. Like what? 
A what we call a leg. 
We have a dummy data streamer. 
So basically this means 1f there is. 
ffi) 
CJ 


Some sort of delivery somewhere. 
In them MCI for this placement. it's going to be 
listed here it whether it's a PlD, whether it's like a 
click like a an impression, an overall reach if there's 
some sort of deli~ry somewhere this this is going 
to show like it's going to pull it into. 
The beta report 
So what we're domg i~ 
What I typically do is depending on which column I 
update, I'll typically just like add a filter at the at 
t he top. 
It I think it has everything that we have a dev for 
pretty much so every field. 
So this is and we can go through it like a little bit 
like one by one. but it t here. 
Are there are like up until BZ is all classifications? 
So what ? 
What we"re looking at these first two columns. 
Are these for two columns are? 
I call like the most important like this is like what 
I'm typically searching for to find a specific 
campaign or an advertiser that launched. 
The Buy key is typically like. 
Is typically li ke the like media like the. 
It could sometimes be 
The Prisma ID. 
It's mostly the Prisma ID. 
But if it's another platform. you'll see like 
sometimes it changes. 
But it's mostly the Prisma ID for anything that we 
use Prismafor. 
Media buy name is the placement name, so that's 
what we call placement names in here. 
Media by package name is the package campaign. 
Advertiser is how the advertiser is set up in the 
platform and t he campaign name is how it's also 
set up i n t he platform. 
It does not go down to creative. 
No, I only have a bunch of clusters like 400,000 
rows like maybe it does. 
I had no idea. 
So 11's solely just looking at placement and 
package level hke data. 
And t hen everything else 1s pretty much all the like 
So this is exactly what we are receiving from the 
platforms and then everything else 1s what we're 
domg as like a d1mens1on. 
In in MCI so franchise is pretty much what we it's 
t his 1s an old field but this 1s the way we used to 
split out brands on Novartis before hke the merger 
before everything be<:ame like innovat ive 
medicines. 
So we typically don't update this anymore because 
franchise 1s no longer a t hing, but we ha~ it here. 
Agam, for the historical context. for like 2023, 
when it was still a thmg. 
lpmm brand name. So we're we're currently 
d1scussing Just usmg lpmm brand name moving 
forward to make sure that we're like like across the 
board to like make sure we're aligned to what like 
Novartis 1s looking at what we·re kloking at. 
Yet but this is basically 
What the lpmm team is going to want to see their 
analysis like when they go to do the analysis. 
This is how they want things broken out so they 
can make requests to us of. like we might not say 
on our side. 
We might not break out something a certain way, 
but t hey want to see it that way. 
We'll come in here and l ike add the break for t hem 
so t hat when we they go to analyze. 
The data it's it 's set up the way that they want it 
Brand report name is j ust the actual like like 
Master brand. I guess l can place it like how I place 
it manager is. 
This would be considered the master brand. 
This is the Deb Field for brand report name. Brand 
market name is what the name of the drug is in 
market 
So this typically matches what the brand report 
Don't use it quite that often. 
The dev for the brand market name indication is a 
big one. 
So like brand report name and indication are like 
t he big ones for u~ Indication is how like they 
need the like you know just breaking out the 
indication for the brand~ 
This is we end up having to manipulate this one a 
tot because. 
Display and video and e-mail ts fine. 
But. 
Yeah, I thought it did all I know. 
That's not t hat's makes me nervous. 
Basically, display video e-mail is fine. 
Any platform where we're executing from Prisma is 
fine, right? 
Because, like we have placement level data that 
has the indication in it as long as they filled out 
correctly, get QA correctly. we're usually OK here, 
but search and social sometimes we have an issue 
with especially a search because t hey have their 
own hke nomenclature for wit hin plat. 
Sometimes they royally botch it so we typically 
might have to come in here and like, make. 
Hard codings for like certain placements and or 
like. 
Campaign level replacement le~l in search to 
make sure it goes to the proper indication. 
They've been a little bit better about it but it still 
pops up from time to t ime where we have to 
basically say if this campaign is this, then please 
make the indication this like in the in the 
calculated field. 


So everything is set up the same way. 
It's just like the live field and then the dead field. 
So if you go across. it's everything. 
So it can't be a branding. branded or unbranded. 
Like I s.aid before. we started using we we used to 
have a boat. 
We no longer use both. 
It's like a very rare case. 
They"re not allowed to do a branded on branded 
campaign. 
We have 
What is campaign type? 
Oh. just like I we rarely use that. 
So I'm I'm guessing that's why there's no depth 
fields for that audience. 
HEPPTC market access flag 
So somet imes we have a campaign that"s market 
I think there·s now in placement manager a like yes 
or no feature like where if it is a market access they 
just have to market yes. 
So this is just a flag on if it is one of those 
campaign types. 
Campaign targeting. 
A bunch of d ifferent types of, like if ifs AP 2P. If it's 
like a conference. 
That'll be tisted here. 
Sometimes aga11"\ we have to do a hard code 
override if they forget to actually put that. If it's a 
what conference it is, or if it is a PCP campaign. 
This is the Bl targeting type for the package level 
informat ion. 
So helpful for hke NPI data. 
Same kind of thing 
It's like just. 
Listing out if ifs a conference, we typically don't 
update this unless somebody asks us to o r if. like 
Jackie asked us to. 
Campaign mess.aging. 
lt"s if t hey have a certain type of a specific 
messaging. 
This is where we update if the campaign is like 
adse campaign when it's unbranded. 
Again. typically things that we get asked to update. 
That that we get asked to update. We don"t 
typically just like go ahead and update this unless 
Jackie or somebody else makes t he request 
Report name is so I know we have brand report 
name and report name. The brand report name is a 
concatenate that helps form. I think the lpmm 
name. The report name is what we see when when 
we're dashboarding. 
So this is like what we pull in in our dashboards. 
To put the filters at the top. So like the teams can 
access like what? 
You know what they're looking for? 
This is b.:isically the conc.:itenate of t he. 
The brand 
The audience, and if it's like a DSl like unbranded 
campaign. 
So it's j ust like the concatenate of everything 
together. 
The dev site name. 
So this is just 
The actual sites. 
We I don't think we typically update this again. 
which is why we don't have a dev in here. 
We typJCally update partner. 
That's what we use to. 
That's what everybody sees in our drop downs and 
t heir dashboard. 
This is wh.:it we refer to the partner as. 
So l think site name is just to see like what's 
getting triggered from like t he nomenclature 
basically. 
It's just a lot. 
That was a lot of the issues ·cause. I just feel like I 
see a lot of site names or site codes 
Yeah, all over the place. 
Sometimes, nonsensically, sometimes, like even t he 
strategy, like oops, kind of situations. 
Yeah. Yeah. No, we definitely. 
This is why we have the partner fietd to clean up all 
t heir mistakes. basically. 
So this is just all capital version, so if they make 5 
different. 
If they make S d ifferent AMC networks. 
This is .:ill you're saying. 
On your side, no matter where you activated it or 
what code you used, this is what you're getting. 
Yeah. So. 
It's not. 
Like this is taking all of the like randos stuff in 
place. 
The manager in Prisma and like just like funneling 
it into something that"s like standardized. 
Yeah, I get I mean. 
Michael Kluence s.aymg and this is a detour, but I 
do always wonder like we, you know, it has to look 
like this. 
Mm hmm. And every year they send out a list hke. 
Here·s the values for this year, but we still end up 
with things that are like a strategy person kicks. 
Health, UN and somebody picks healthy U and 
somebody picks like Health 0G like why are these 
and there is that because t hey're on the d rop 
down like they"re available in place of manager. 
So yeah. Can we do anything to make that not? I 
t hink the problem is is that and I don't know from. 
So like with our side, we have a different process 
where. 
Because we're using the Starcom Prisma, they have 
:i ~nP<""ifir. 


Approval process of like codes t hat they're allowed 
to use and for a while l was like asking their client 
OPS team. I'm like can you remove the codes that 
,:1ren't like approved or like the code'5 th,:1t are no 
longer in use? 
There was some hurdle with that, but like for our 
side, there is a list on box th,:1t is like the Starcom 
approved suppliers list. 
It is literally the only codes for that year that the 
te,:1ms are supposed to use. 
And prisma? 
Michael takes t hat list from our side and puts it. 
In to puts it into placement mc1nager, but from 
what I understand there can be mult iple codes 
based on like the buy type because they make the 
codes based on the 10 terms that they have wit h 
the partner and those 10 terms can change. 
So it's up to like the strategy team to know 
What like? 
Which one they·re selecting goes with like the buy 
that they like, the agreement that they just made. 
Like, clearly they don"! know. 
11 I never got, nor did I ask for a full explanation of 
strategy. 
But we would see like you know how things. t he 
be'5t example, if they go there like it would if one 
year was help you and next year it was healed you 
Like yeah. why? 
Like they probably the terms change ,:1nd OK 
Yeah, that'd be a good re,:1son. 
11 do think once or twice not with health. You 
know. I got the answer j ust like you just thought. 
Like th,:1t was on the list. So we just taped it like we 
Just saw that one first. 
Yeah, well, it wasn't what it was before. So we gotta 
change a lot now. 
I j ust like sometimes I could. OK so that makes 
more sense, though I never got that reason that 
like that term change and the code changes. But 
also if we have a finite ,:1mount of codes, how many 
times can the first change? 
I know, I know. Or like, why can't you just like 
what? There must be something preventing to 
update. 
The pnor use code like. I'm curious to know what 
that reasoning is, but it's like OK if it's updatmg. 
then why can't t he people who ,:1re in charge of the 
codes in Prisma revoke the codes in Pnsma at the 
start of the new Year? You know really fuzzy one. 
Time I had th,:1t requested code for Prism,:1 ,:1nd it 
was hke, Oh my God, this is an ordeal 
Yeah, I didn't realize it was so involved with 
everything. No, I know. 
But I was just thinking of it because we talked 
about how much we need to clean up in here 
because all these codes and I feel like it st,:1rts at 
that list t hat Michael sends every calendar year to 
Like if that was just where it has to be. But I mean 
none of those reasons for everything. 
Yep, but sometimes the explanations can't really 
make me wonder. 
I know, I know. 
It 's crazy. It's crazy. 
And it"s yeah. like what? 
We"re what we·re hoping to do like now. So like I 
h.Kl asked Jackie in the past. I was like, why do we 
use the calculate dimensions for a lot of these 
versus just using? 
Placement manager and she basically said that 
Like ftve years ago, when we set out placement 
manager like we didn"t have like the data Rama 
aspect in mind and that if that were the case, she 
would have executed placement manager a lot 
differently than what we had done on Novartis. 
And a lot of the fields don"t line up to like what like 
Novartis needs. So like. 
But now that we"ve spent years cleaning up 
placement manager, that"s part of the like. That"s 
part of the idea behind the 2020 code 
Is !ike trying to pull in. What playset manager now 
says and seeing if we can use it because we were 
able lo make those adjustments over !he course of 
the last couple years. 
So now we might be able to actually use what's in 
Prisma and then like we didn't take away 
accordingly versus 1ike really relying on these like 
calculated like manual writ ing definitions so 
Maybe there"s? 
Maybe we could do it. 
Maybe it won"t be as painful. 
Who knows? 
We'll we'll just have to test it out, ye,:1h. 
But yeah, well, yeah, if anything ever comes up 
where we can help with the initial like. 
I don't match streamline, which is like the way the 
data does go in place of manager. We do these big 
I'd be happy to help because I wasn't on the data 
manager te,:1m, but I was really close to it before 
they made that team specific arxl I talked to 
Michael a lot about it. 
Pretty good. That's how that works. 
And how I understand how the strategy team and 
the QA actually works too 'cause I might go a lot 
on that. 
A lot of frustration there from all the teams on how 
that works and I feel like there's there's just got to 
be a better way. But like I said. you guys know 
more than two. So it's kind of not as simple 
sometimes I think honest. Yeah, t here is. 
An opportunity I wouldn't mind. 
Oh yeah. there is absolutely an opportunity for 
that because like I know. 
The last year Michael still handled it for like 
Novartis. Like all the stuff that was going on. 


I don't think he's gomg to be able to do that this 
year, so we·re probably gonna need like a little 
point of contact from like our side. So l can have 
you work like closely with him on au that. 
Yeah. Yeah. not not necessarily. For his data brick 
stuff, 1 wasn't 
Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. I know, right 
Tangent was actually working with him pretty close 
on that. and I talked to Ray a lot ,1bout it. 
Too coot. 
Let me sit there and chat there. 
Yeah. Yeah. but yeah. 
Oh yeah. there has to be. 
Yeah, there has to be. 
Sometimes it's imposs solutions. 
Yeah, it might not be here, but I've been avoidmg 
that a lot of times. The first thing I do is like lers 
troubleshoot the back end code of t his. 
And did you try turning it off? Oh. yeah. 
Oh yeah. I know I do the same thing. 
You thmk it's a lot more complicated than it 
actu,1!!yis,. so. 
Yeah. 
Cool. but yeah. so we have a few other fields here. 
So again. these are just t think these are actually 
t he anything that says PM before are things we're 
pulling in from placement manager. 
So as you can see, we are trying to see what what's 
going on in here. 
This is actually gonna change, so r m gonna skip 
that for now. 
lpmm tactics. so this is new. 
We're t rying to. 
We're t rying to port 
Over actually what 1s? 
Wait no, is ipmm no ipmm by channel is gonnc1 be 
Sorry, but yeah, this is just our tactic level 
informc1t ion for the the plc1cements. 
ProgrammatK partner is actually Just listing out if it 
like we roll up everything 
So if it's like if it our programmatic team is using 
tradesk deep intent and pulsepoint everything 
gets. everything gets categonied as like open 
exchange like our progr,1mmatic team executed it 
and then if they did not execute it then there's like 
other. 
ldent ifier5-
There's like the we do use like PMP for a lot of 
t heir. The deals like with programmat ic deals with 
partners. 
So you'll see that come up from time to time too. 
like. 
To here. yeah. 
So a bunch of our PMP deals with like direct with 
like individual partners. 
Crossix other you guys also? 
I think this is segments. 
Like from the programmatic aspect. 
Umm, probably from the past yeah. 
Yeah, yeah. 
You have to deal with like you and me directly. Or 
is that more to reasons? 
We have to deal with lqvia fro m like the 
measurement side of the House, and then Theresil 
is dec1ling with iqvia as like the direct partner. 
Who took over DMD, if that makes sense. 
So like they own DMD Now. DMD connects I think 
is iqvia oh, it's like it's like a it's a like a HTP 
partner. 
So lqvia took over dmda 
So now it's just considered iqvia. which l hilte, 
because then I get confused. 
So I'm like, are we talking ilbout iqva 
measurement? 
Are we talking about lqvia partner? 
Yeah, like as ii partner. They're the worst I think. 
yeah. 
Horrible, but as measurement I want to 
Crossix opportunity. Yes. No, they are way better 
than. 
They're better t han crossix. but they're less 
sophisticated than com score. 
Like I wish comScore could do more be<:ause. 
There I think that their lilgging tech 1s better than 
ii qvi or a piece of cake when we need someone 
manager, I love thilt. 
They're not always the best in the most 
commutative, but like they it's just so so much 
easier like I. 
When we started with iqvia I like had a really hard 
t ime wit h them ilnd a lot of fights because they. 
Didn't understand how t heir tag worked like t he 
guy that Malcolm didn't like. 
Did you work with Makolm? Yeah. 
I can't 
I had to be like your tags broke. And here is where 
it's broke 
And then they were like, oh. you. There was like, 
our tag does not work in innovid. 
So you're gonna have to ask us for a an IQ. 
Tag for every individual video placement and I was 
like, no, we·re gonna hop on a phone call and 
we're gonna talk about how your tag does not 
work in innovid and figure out how to get it to 
~,· 
That's what we're gonna do. 
And we figured it out. 
And I'm like you. 
Hi1ve you been telling c1II the partners t hat you 
work with? 
This awful awful. 


Yeah, not my favorite, but if it works. ifs fine. 
It's outside of that. 
Report the door. 
Yeah, I was like, no, no, no. We're not doing that. 
We're gonna figure out how we're gonnJ fix your 
tag. 
That's what I told 
Yeah, I don't. 
I like we used last year, we had both comScore and 
and rN and t hey were using. 
ComScore because some of the old oncology 
brands were getting some type of audience quality 
from them that they like preferred or liked. And 
t hen like lqvo was like a traditional partner that like 
the old pharma s.ide was using. 
So we kind of had overlap and had to use bot h of 
t hem for a little bit and then t his year they decided 
t hat no, we we're not going lo do the JUSL 
It's not worth it doing t he COM score. 
Yeah, they were just doing ii for a few brands and 
we're like, this does not make sense. 
So they agreed. 
And t hey JUSt went with lqvia so. 
But yeah, so am ( going to go through the rest of 
t hese? 
But you can 
You'll be able to, like, I'll send you one of these and 
you can kind of go through and then Just let me 
know if I get one, yeah. 
Oh. OK. 
Cool. You just let me know if you have any 
questions as you go through it. 
I know. right? 
There's a lot of stuff al the end that our search 
specific. 
That we do update. 
I just want to kind of go through that really quick. 
Wedo. 
A lot on. 
The social stuff again. 
If social. what happens is typically social qa's and 
lets us know the wrong funnel or the wrong social 
obJect. 
The objective is showing and it needs. They tel1 
you what it should be, and then we Just update it 
to that like it's pretty simple. 
It's not like a guessing game for us. 
Like we say. if they don't provide il we say. what 
do you want it to be listed as? 
And t hen they tell us they'd be tike. oh. this is 
supposed to be action. or this supposed to be 
awareness. And it's showing as. like. education we 
go. OK. we'll update it. 
Same thing with obj ective. They'll tell us it's 
showing his reac~ but it needs to be leg. OK 
updated for you. 
Like that's it. 
And then search. 
Similar thing we don't have too much here, but 
once in a while it will show up incorrectly and we 
just will hard code an individual campaign, but 
that's it. 
But yeah, so we this is what we 2A and I in t hat 
document I sent you on box. 
Do I still have it open? 
Umm. 
What will the cost? 
lt was. 
Dev cla55ification expectations. 
It should be in that folder. 
Somewhere. but it was just like weird, one that 1 
was showing you yesterday of like what the field 
does. 
What the name is of evidentev? 
What the field does and then what? What I did for 
Kyle is I was like when you're QA ING an update 
t hat you made, this is what you should be 
checking. I the other fields that you should be 
checking against to make sure that the update that 
yoo 
Made didn't impact these other columns. 
So what 1 typically do is if I'm qaing something. 
That he made an update for us to say he came in 
here and he was like I had to do an indication 
update. Like if it's a broad update. a broad stroke 
update. I will typically go to the indication t he dev 
field indicat ion. 
Select whatever one he updated for the brand 
So like all typical. we should probably narrow it 
down to the brand first. 
So I'll typically say he made the update for Xolair. 
So I will pull up just Xolair and t hen I will then see 
like, OK. does the QA against the like do a true 
false QA against the indication? 
And be like OK does like. 
I like pull up OK. 
He updated a A like, Is t his actually all a A? 
And t hen I will typ1c.3l1y like look at hke that. 
Typically see what he updated. Again. th1s is kind 
of like a manual thing. 
Hold on. Let me pull up. I think. 
Tiy to understand. 
Yeah, the whole damn document. And I think he 
might. Yeah. 
Or 1 guess you heard. So after we do. 
Make our updates on our end of the platform. 
This is really like the final, like we're j ust checking 
again and t he very last step like this is definitely 
how we're seeing it 
So we make sure it looks right. 
Yeah. Yeah. exactly. 
Like you wanna Just make sure that whatever dev 
column you updated First off reflects the update 


.,,,..,.,...,..., ..... ,..,.. . ,...,~•uu..,,..,_.,.,,.,..,,.

This is Buffy's nomendature corner. 
She has approved this training, so that 
means it's very official. 
Jacqueline Derron 0:13 
So based off of this. we are going through 
the digital boot camp again. 
CX If you guys are on this is great. 
Totally like for you guys to be here, but at 
the same time, this is gonna be very much 
centered around information for the direct 
programmatic video. 
Endpoint of care team. 
So please keep that in mind. 
So. Kylie, do you want to go to the next 
slide? 
X 
Here are links to everything you need when 
it comes to placement manager. 
So we're gonna be talking about just 
placement manager itself. 
That's the link to log in. If you need access, 
you have to submit a JIRA ticket. 
Pub Media is the ones that own placement 
manager. 
It's part of the OS. so they're gonna ask: for 
your lion log in. 
They're the ones that get you access if you 
guys last minute need access, I can't help 
you. 
So I'm not the person who can grant you 
access. 
So please keep that in mind if you ever 
need additional fields in place. A manager in 
the drop down there is a link there. 
So that you can submit to the smartsheet 
form to get any new fields added to 
placement manager. If you ever have issues 
with placement manager, you can't log in. 
You can't. 
You know something's running slow. 
The AP is not working. 
You need to submit a JIRA ticket. 
There again. that's not something that I can 
help you out with. 
That's gonna be on the pub media team. 
Creative manager is basically placement 
manager. but at the creative level that is the 
link that your team. 
The creative aor's log into to get to creative 
manager to put in their creat ive names and 
to get their. 
Q their data. 
To get their. 
HTML banners QA. 
And then there is our metric tactic 
dictionary there that will have all of the HCP 
campaigns and their tactics and each of the 
metrics that we collect for it. So that is a list 
that we maintain with all the partners. So 
the partners, every time they have a. 
Whole new tactic. like let's say they update 
their sales deck and they launch a, you 
Chapters 
Notes 
Comments 


let's say they will send us that tactic name. 
We have a complete list. 
It has a unique ID and then we know every 
single met ric that we will get to t hat new 
tactic. 
So that's our complete list. 
It is updated every day. 
That is also t he list of t he tactic fields that 
you'll see in placement manager when 
you're building out your buys. 
So this is your one stop shop for all your 
links. 
Do you wanna go to the next slide? 
So everything that you guys put in 
placement manager is super, super 
important because it's what we use to 
connect all of our digital data together. 
So we're using that unique ID from 
placement manager to a connect to 
replacement manager, right? 
So that's where we get all of our 
classificat ions. 
That's how we know you got a podcast. 
That's how we know if it was tagged or not. 
That's how we know what Prisma product 
name. 
It's under what the site name is everything 
that we. 
Into any of our reporting. 
Anything for ipmm. It all comes from 
placement manager. 
So super super important that you start 
there, then once you push it to Prisma 
Prisma's where we pull spend for our direct 
campaigns, then it gets pushed to any of 
our ad servers, right? 
So it's the same name in Flash talking DCM 
and INNOVID, and then that IED is how we 
connect to our double verify data, our 
viewability, our brand safety. 
And then it's also if it's programmatic. how 
we go to the Dsps and we connect to get all 
of our DSP spend 'cause when we report 
out on programmatic. we pull spend from 
the Dsps. 
It's how we get the data from the partners. 
So if you guys ever are running something 
that has NP1 data that we are collect ing. we 
need that placement manager ID because 
it's how we connect everything together. 
And it's also how we connect to IQ via data. 
If we are running a OTC campaign that can 
be tagged. 
So this ID is essential. 
And it has to be unique for each one of your 
packages and your placements. 
Next slide. 
So because we're connecting everything 
together using that ID, t his data that you're 
entering into placement manager and into 
Prisma, it supports all of these client 
deliverables, most importantly the one that 
we talk about constant ly is ipmm or that's 
our marketing mix model. We need data to 
be at. 
The NPI level. or it's at the OMA level. 
Utm parameters. 
I'm gonna say it. 
Don't do nu. 
We cannot use that data for our analysis. so 
we must for ipmm, have NPI data or OMA 
level data. 
All of this data that we talked about is being 
put into imdna. 
That is the database where we house all of 
our data. 
That is the name that Novartis gave it 
imdna. 
So if you ever hear imdna, that is our 
database. 
That is where all of this data that you guys 
are entering gets stored. 
And where we automate all of our 


reporting, how Novartis automates all of 
their reporting, It's all coming from the 
same location, t he same database, and t hat 
reporting that we're talking about are these 
dashboards, right? 
So you have the N2 dashboards. 
Those are the ones that you guys are linked 
to in teams that we review every month. 
Novartis is logging in and looking at this 
exact same data in their dashboards and 
MCI. MCI is the same name as data Rama 
Datarama got purchased by Salesforce. 
They renamed it MCI. 
Marketing cloud intelligence. 
So j ust keep that in mind. This data feeds 
not j ust MCI their data Rama, but it also 
feeds Novartis dashboards that they call I 
am best all of this data as well. We use for 
automation right. 
So we are trying to automate everything 
that we do and the reason being is we don't 
want you guys having to have to spend 
your time on this, right? 
So the more you guys enter your data 
incorrectly, t he more we can automate and 
that means you know, going and reaching 
out. 
Partners for their pacing. Data will use this 
data. 
You know everything that we talk about 
from moving data from the media tools into 
place manager into Prisma. 
Everything needs this data to be clean and 
be correctly entered in, otherwise we can't 
automate it. 
And then last but not least we use all the 
data that you ent er mostly to get our NPI 
data collection right. 
All of that data you enter it in, we use 
triggers. right? 
Oh, you put in its HCP. That tells us we need 
to. 
Go and look at it for NPI data. 
Oh, you put in that the data provider is. 
That t hat we're getting data for this 
program. 
That's how we know how to reach out and 
get data. 
Oh, you put planned units in. 
Oh, that's how we know it's live. 
So we use t his data for everythi ng to 
support all of these client deliverables. 
So it's super important that you think about 
what you're entering into the system so that 
you don't mess anythi ng up down the road, 
right? 
So can you go to the next slide? 
0 most importantly, when we talk about all 
this data, it's not just for our reporting, but 
it's really for ipmm and our marketing mix 
models, right ? 
Keep in mind UTM parameters and or 
innovid tags do not provide DMA level data, 
So for our ipmm what we do is we first say 
hey, do we get NPI data for this program if 
we do great we're good, we're golden, we 
can do our analysis. 
The next thing we check for is do we have 
campaign manager or DCM DMA level 
data? 
It has to be DMA level data, lnnovid does 
not give us OMA level data. 
You must. 
You have something in innovid. You also 
need adcm 1 by 1 tag so that we get the 
OMA level data. Utm parameters do not 
give us any data. 
Nothing, absolutely nothing. 
OK. If I could get rid of them, I would. 
That is not going to give us what we need 
for ipmm if we cannot tag a buy, which this 
has to be very, very, very limited, 
Did right this is our rustom programs like 
messy or basil or point of care programs or 


aaoressaote MVt'U. vve nave to reacn om to 
the partners and it's a lot of extra work to 
do that. 
So if we do not tag, then the next step is 
OK. we'll go to the partner and we say, hey, 
do you guys have OMA level data? If they 
don't, then they'll give U.S. Nat ional data 
and we'll ask them. OK. welt how much of 
your audience at the? 
OMA level is in each OMA. 
And they'll give us a percent of their 
audience at the OMA level. 
So we'll take the nat ional level data and 
distribute it down to the OMA level data 
based off of those percentages. 
If they can't give us their audience and tell 
us what percent of their audience is in each 
OMA. we take t he nat ional data and we 
distributed it down to the OMA level data 
OMA level with census data. 
All of this to say is those options in pink 
need to be a last resort. 
It's a lot of time and it's a lot of work on our 
plate and these publishers all send the data 
in different formats, so then we have to 
manually reorganize it. 
Don't do this. 
OK. 
Very, very, very little amount of your 
program should not be tagged. 
Everything should at least have a click tag 
on it so that we can track it and we can get 
OMA level data. 
Sounds good. 
Feel free, by the way guys, if you do have 
questions to go off, mute and ask quest ions., 
it is allowed. 
OK. 
So thinking about how you're entering your 
data into placement manager, we i n 
placement manager the best thing about it 
is that t here's strings and the string is just 
what we call the name, right? 
So when you go and you put stuff into 
placement manager, it gives you a name. It 
gives you a campaign string, a package 
stri ng and a placement string. 
And we have our unique IDs in them. 
Don't reuse placement manager IDs, right? 
So if you are not using the API and you're 
manually copy and pasting. 
Things in do not ever reuse a placement 
manager ID for more than one program. 
We take this ID and t hat's how we go into 
the back end of placement manager and we 
see metadata, right? 
So you're entering a bunch of data into 
placement manager t hat does not end up in 
these names or in t hese strings. 
Anything that's not in the strings, you can 
go into placement manager and update 
post launch so you do not need to. 
Rename anything if you don't see the field 
in in the string. 
So like tactic names, right? 
That's not here in the stri ng or in the names. 
You can go into placement manager and 
update that at any time. So if you ever 
made a mistake on one of those fields. it's 
OK. go and update it in placement manager. 
You can do that post launch anything in the 
strings if you have to updat e it please. 
Try to rename it. 
You'll need to rename it in if it's like let's. 
You got the the rate type incorrectly. 
Oh no. We remove t he rate type. l et's say 
that in the Bl targeting type you did not call 
out that it was P2P, that BTG 1. 
That should say P2P. If you were ever 
running a PR campaign that's in the string, 
you would need to go and rename it in 
placement manager. 
Rename it in Prisma. 
Rename it in campaign manager lnnovid, 


Hash talkmg. 
Double verify the Dsps if it's programmatic 
and the publishers if it's HCP. So if you need 
to change something in the string, you need 
to change t hat string in every single 
location. 
Particularly for NPI. you need t o tell the 
publishers there's a new there's a new 
sheriff in town. and they need to be using 
the new names. 
So make sure you are calling that out 
And you are always updating the names in 
every single location. 
If you ever have to update the string. 
This is post launch. 
Any questions? 
OK. 
Next slide. 
So once we are done with this training, the 
direct and the programmatic point of care 
and video teams, you guys will need to 
finish these four st eps. 
First we're gonna have you update 2025 
placement manager for metadata fields to 
make sure that t hey've correctly been 
entered into the system. 
These are metadata fields, so again you just 
have to update them in placement manager 
only there. So at the package level you'll 
going to. 
The Bl inventory type. 
This is also referred to as the budget 
channel or the channel itself. You're going 
to update the t actic name if it's incorrect so 
if it's a doc spot and you put in run of sit e, 
you need to update it to say Doc spot in the 
tactic name field. 
At t he placement level. 
We're asking you to update t he Bl format 
type which is going to be the sub channel. 
So this is just updating it to make sure that 
it is correct and that it matches your. 
2025 media plans. 
The next thing that you're going to need to 
update is any place in Prisma where there 
are no planned units. Every single buy, even 
flat buys or buys that don't have any metric 
guarantees, must have planned units. 
And that is how we are able to a see what's 
live. But B also we're using it to migrate 
spend. 
So if we had spend in January, but the buy 
didn't go live until March, we use plan. 
It's to take the spend from January and put 
it into March, so you must update all of 
2025 for your programs to have Prisma plan 
units and for those to be correctly flighted 
out for all of 2025. 
#3 you will need to update 2024 and 2025. 
Do not use buys. So any time you have a do 
not use right so do not use is are used. 
Do not use. This are used when you are 
retrafficking. 
So let's say you got the Prisma product 
name wrong. 
You got the campaign name wrong or you 
got t hat supplier ID wrong and you had 
already launched the campaign. You'd 
closed it out for t he month and you created 
a new package, new placements, new 
everything. 
We need you to t ie the old packages and do 
not use to the new ones. 
And we want you to use the billing line item 
PRISM. 
A package ID to do t hat. So t ake t he Prisma 
package ID from your. Do not use and put it 
into the new package that you created as a 
billing line item. 
Prisma package ID we're going to go 
through an example in here. So t hese three 
w ill all go through an example of how we 
do it and then last but not least is we've 
created Marcel Trainings. 
That will be a very complicated quiz. 1 wrote 


it. 
Very excited about it that you will need to 
complete and pass. 
So these are the next steps, and we're 
gonna go through all of these. 
OK. 
So let's just talk about setting up your buy 
at an overall level. 
So first is making sure that you're choosing 
the correct Prisma product name, right? 
We have a very, very, very set process now. 
For every si ngle time you launch a new 
product, a new product is like a new brand. 
So first and foremost is do not launch a 
creative rotation for branded versus 
unbranded or multiple indications. 
They have to be in a new product. 
I get questions all the time, kisqali. EBC and 
NBC yet can't run it as a creative rotation. 
I know t he partner might force you to. 
You can't do it . 
You can't break out ipmm if you do it . 
You can't. let's say that we have, you know, 
a Taco pan that didn't. 
launches fabolta that that got launched as a 
creative rotation, and it was the most 
painful experience t hat I've had on Novartis. 
Do not do it. 
You cannot do it as a creative rotation. 
It needs to be in different Prisma product 
names. 
Your CX team will provide you with a 
product name. 
It's going to have the brand, it's going to 
have the indication even if there's just one 
indication it's going to be branded versus 
unbranded and the audience will be in there 
as well. 
Wow, so some examples below right? lffor 
the brand, if it's adse DSA or also referred to 
as unbranded DSE is disease state 
education. DSA is disease state awareness. 
An example of that would be a Taco pan or 
astrentan. It will then also have the 
indication in there. 
So again, if there is only one indication, it's 
still going to have that indication in the 
name because I bet you money. 
In one year t ime. 
We're gonna have another indication for 
that exact same brand. So no matter what it 
has to include the indication or the 
condition in the name. 
It also needs to include if it's DSE or it's 
branded BRO. 
These are the acronyms we use in the 
names so that we can distinguish between 
the two, and then it will always be broken 
out as your audience, which will be OTC 
versus HCP. And I've given some examples 
to the right. So lptacopan has three 
different indications C3. 
GI Gan pnh. 
It's broken out that way. 
Ashrizentin was an igan. 
It launched and became van Raffia. 
Those are in two separate product names. 
Please keep this in mind. 
#3 is where this does get a little confusing. 
Make sure you're always selecting the same 
Prisma product name year over year, even if 
it doesn't follow the rules below. right? 
So we have some stuff that launched back 
in the day that's just called like pros. 
Still select it right. 
It might not be the best way of naming it 
but we've already worked t hrough our pain 
and have you know, mapped everything to 
that name. 
So j ust select the same one year over year 
because also keep in mind for ipmm we are 
looking back about. 
A year and a half worth of data, sometimes 


two years. 
They want to look back three years, so just 
please keep that in mind that we are always 
looking at stuff for multiple years in a row. 
So This is why it's important. 
Please keep in mind too #4 is that 
sometimes we were unable to use the 
trademark name prior to FDA approval. 
So if it's a branded, we want you to use t he 
trademark name like Fabhalta or Van Raffia. 
But if the client says, hey, man, you can't use 
that name because we don't have FDA 
approval yet and our competitors might see 
that name, you need to meet with us. 
We will help you come up with a name as a 
team and t hat's why we're always meeting 
like we had to do it for. I forget what the 
one that just launched is. 
But we had to do, you know, come up with 
a different name. 
So just make sure that you always are aware 
exactly what name to select here, because if 
you get this wrong, you'll have to ret raffick 
everything. 
Everything needs to be under the correct 
Prisma product name. 
And then also keep in mind t hat your 
corporate and medical brands always have a 
separate product name than any of your 
just general like us oncology or pharma 
buys. 
Questions here because this is super 
important . 
Great. Next slide. 
OK. 
Always so important here. 
All buys guys. 
All buys even non taggable buys must be in 
placement manager wit h a package and a 
placement. 
I don't care what the publisher says, # 1 
Carly told me. 
This one which 11 giggled. 
Just because a partner says w e don't need 
tags doesn't mean that we do not tag. 
Don't listen to your partners, OK? 
Listen to me and what 1 say is we always 
need A tag. 
Even if it's j ust a dick tag, a click tag is a 
link. 
Guys. there should be not one partner 
saying no to this. If t hey are, you get me on 
the phone. OK. I will be your bulldog. 
So anyhow, always need A tag. 
Again, UTM parameters are not enough. 
We can't do anything with them. 
I would get rid of UTM parameters. 
I've t ried, I've tried, tried to get rid of all of 
claravine OK. 
They're not useful things for us when it 
comes to our ipmm reporting, so. 
It's not enough. 
We need that tag in placement manager #2. 
You must create a package and a 
placement. 
I know t hat's confusing because you're like, 
wait t here's nothing tagged. We need both. 
No standalone placements or just 
standalone packages, right? 
They have to have both a package and a 
placement. 
#3 the placement is goi ng to be a zero by 
zero placement. 
We have that. 
We need that placement because at that 
level in our data, that's where we put down 
all the targeting information. 
And the ad serving information. So you got 
to make sure you create one even if it's not 
tagged before the ad serving method is 
going to be siteserved. 
No tags. 
So you're going to tell us, hey, this program 


cannot be tagged. 
You still need to go get data for it. 
That's our problem. 
But like, it still needs to have t hat placement 
so that it tells If its sites are no tags, no. You 
still need it for docximity. 
Everyone needs a placement guys. 
You have to have a placement package and 
placement ad serving method. 
o Gabrielie Charles 23:07 
No, sorry, sorry. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 23:08 
The site served no tags. 
o Gabrielle Charles 23:09 
I meant like in terms of tagging. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 23:1 1 
Oh oh. Doximity is one that we do allow to 
not have tags because and the reason being 
is they always give us NPI data for all of 
their programs, right? 
o Gabrielle Charles 2.3:17 
OK. cool. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 23:24 
That is the only reason we accept that for 
docximity, but you'll still need a placement 
and it'll still need to be a zero by zero 
placement. 
We also need the unique creative 1 by 1 
field to be filled out for non tagged 
programs and this is where we get the 
content ID also referred to as MRR. also 
referred to as the fuse ID. 
So I know it's a little confusing because it 
says one by one, but you still need to put 
your content ID or your MLR or your fuse ID 
there. 
This is for reporting purposes so that we 
always know what that content ID is for that 
buy. 
I'm going to pause any questions. 
OK. 
Next slide. 
Oh, this is our favorite. 
This is my favorite slide and any slide that 
you see a ducky Carly is going to do us a 
demonstration. 
So this is for multi component buys and this 
is an A place where we have a drug 
monograph campaign, right? 
So if you see over here to the left if you go 
and you look at your media plans, this is 
how you can tell how to set up these buys. 
So you'll see for this drug monograph tactic. 
Here we have a banner. 
And we have t rigger a triggered e-mail. 
Now you'll see that the spend is all in the 
direct or emerging display channel. 
That's going to be your Bl inventory type or 
your budget channel. 
So you're going to have that drug 
monograph package, the Bl inventory type 
is going to be display and then you're going 
to have a placement for your banner, your 
Bl format type would be banner for that 
placement and then you're going to have a 
placement. 
For your triggered e-mail, the Bl format 
type. 
Will be a custom e-mail because t riggered 
emails are custom emails. 
So you're gonna have the package is gonna 
be your budget and then at the placement 
level is where you tell us what the assets 
are, OK. 
So this is where it gets super important, 
because a lot of the teams got a little 
confused here and might have created two 
n~rk:rnP~. 


Really, we want one package, 2 placements. 
So Carly, I'll pass it over to you. 
Do you wanna go through an example? 
Carly Fisher 25:42 
Sure. Let me just pull up. 
Can you guys see the placement manager 
now? 
Or are you still seeing the deck? OK. perfect. 
So I can just make an example using . 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 25:52 
Yes. 
Carly Fisher 26:01 
The I'm just in one of the Cosentyx 
campaigns just because. 
I'm just gonna do one as an example and 
can remove it after but so for this example, 
when we're making the package, you would 
fill out all of t he package information. 
For the drug monograph, for example, so I 
can use t hat one. 
So we can just go through. 
Some of these real quick just so. 
We can get to the part where. 
We need to tie them together. 
So I'm just filling this information out how 
we typically would for. 
A display package, so t his part here is where 
you would click for the Bl inventory. 
Retype is where you would click display 
even though there's an e-mail included in 
the package or triggered e-mail, you would 
still click display as Jackie said before the 
money is being spent on the display tactic 
and the e-mail. 
Just we get with the buy. 
So then this is not a conference. 
And then the rate type. 
Umm for this we can put as flat. 
It's not added value or make good, it's a 
byline item. 
Publisher or sorry, this one we'll do add 
server because it's a monograph. 
And then there is no billing line item that 
we need to account for. 
You'll rollover was not previously. 
Live. Let's j ust say it's live for full year for 
this example. 
And then let's just say we can just say, for 
example sake that this started. 
Yesterday and is going through the end of 
the month display by and t hen here you 
would click standard again. 
It's on t he package level and then for 
unique publisher ID. I don't believe 
Metscape has one. 
So we can. 
Put an A and then I j ust realized 1 missed a 
few up here, so I'm just adding in the ones 
that I missed. 
Npi data provider will be metscape as 
they're providing the data and then the 
tactic here will just be the drug monograph. 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 28:39 
Just one thing to note here. 
Why there's two different N Pl data 
providers? 
That is because sometimes the provider 
might be 1 heart. 
Let's say that like you're running with I 
heart. But lqva is the one that sends us the 
NPI data provider. 
So just keep that in mind. That's why we 
have those fields in two separate fields 
there. 
So just keep. 
That's something that"s unique. 
Carlv Fisher 29:13 


• 
OK .• And then? 
For this I'm just putting in some numbers 
here. 
Just for example purposes. I don't know off 
the top of my head what these numbers 
would be, but I'm just gonna make sure that 
I filled in all t he parameters needed. 
looks like I forgot that one. 
So then when you click save and out of 
placement. 
It'll bring you to the placement area. 
Yeah. So then first you would build out the 
actual monograph drug monograph tactic 
itself. 
So for placement or format type, we can use 
or is it? 
No. 
Banner. 
Placement description. 
Drug monograph. 
Ad serving method you would do, but it's 
being served as and then device type it can 
be. 
Cross devices. 
Verification. 
And then. 
Pack. Sorry for dimensions, you want to 
make what the actual dimensions would be 
for the package so. 
Drug monograph. 
Let's just do. 
Size. OK. And then here for the Bl format 
type, the inventory type is still display and 
then the format type would be a banner. 
Inventory type would be publisher, direct. 
O&O and then for t he creative 10. Since this 
is not like a custom creative, we can j ust put 
this. 
You can see here if it's not a one by one. 
you can just put Sofia not one by one. 
And then forward type you would just put 
the targeting. So I can just do target list. 
Right now data provider will be. 
Should be Medscape, as they're the ones 
who are providing t he data, but I don't see 
those them in here. 
Oh, 'cause, we it's actually gonna be the 
target list. 
Never mind. 
So it could be first party data for client 
'cause we get the data from artists and then 
audience quality. 
Since it's HCP, we don't have any diverse 
targeting. 
Yeah. And then we can leave this all the 
same. 
And then create and add another. So then 
for the e-mail you'd wanna update the 
placement or format type t o be. 
Hmm. 
E-mail which you know custom e-mail. 
And then for the placement description, you 
can add in. 
E-mail to the placement name so that way 
you can track between the two which is for 
the e-mail which is for the actual tactic, and 
then for the ad server method. 
It'll be site served with one by one and then 
no verification. 
Then just making sure that all of these will 
stay the same dimensions we want to make 
as a one by one, and then for Bl inventory 
type this will stay. 
As display as the funding is associated with 
the actual drug monograph and then for 
the format type, that's where we will click 
display triggered e-mail. 
For the creative 10, you would put the 
creative fuse code that you're using for the 
trigger. 
E-mail if you don't have this at the time that 


yvu · ~ "-11:'dUI I Y 
U I ~ l-'ld ... ~ 111~ 111., yvu "-dl l fJU L 
an A and then update it on the back end, 
Once you get the creative assignment, but 
you will need to update this to be the 
correct creative ID, so I'll just put. 
Na for right now, since I don't know t he 
creative assignment yet. 
And then you can just click add and you can 
see i n. 
Placement manager. 
I'm just gonna go to the job monograph. 
You can see or actually. I'll go to the 
package tab. 
You can see that t here's now this package 
and then within the package you will have 
the banner placement and then also the 
custom e-mail placement. And then from 
here you could just push to Prisma and then 
it will show up in Prisma. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 34:25 
Azim. 
Thank you, Carly. 
Don't forget to go back and update your 
creative IDs once you have them right. 
That's the reason it's in the metadata. It 
means that you can always updat e those 
fields, right? 
Anything in the metadata, you can always 
go and update anything in the st rings. You 
cannot. 
The strings are the names. 
OK. next slide. 
So in placement manager, you're also going 
to see added value and make good flags, 
That's a yes, no. 
So for added value that's any media that's 
provided. Typically when the campaign has 
been approved. 
It's basically a. It's offered based off of a 
partnership, making sure that we spend a 
certain amount. 
It's going to be additional met rics, basically. 
we just didn't agree to pay for it. 
We got this for free. 
AME Good is when something went wrong. 
Amit Good is when something 
underperformed. 
It didn't run as planned. 
Maybe the ad didn't serve correctly. 
It ran in the wrong placement. 
Maybe we underdelivered. 
They owe U.S. media, so t herefore we want 
to make sure that they're separate packages 
for added value. There are separate 
packages for make goods. The rate type 
should be free placement manager. 
You j ust say yes if it's added value. 
Or no if it's not in the in the added value 
section. There's also just a a drop down that 
does make good. 
You put yes or no there too for a 
makegood. 
We need this for our verification reporting 
that we do. 
We have t o report out on all of our added 
value and all of our baked goods. 
We're also gonna meet with the verification 
team to talk about what we do in over 
delivery situations and we'll follow up with 
some training on that too. 
OK. 
So we do some weird stuff on Novartis, 
right? 
And the main the one thing that we do have 
happen sometimes is you might have a 
scenario where we have many tactics, but 
there's only one package. So anytime we 
have multiple tactics that are gonna be 
running, but the partner only wants to put it 
all in one. 
Package you have to create what's called a 
billing line item. 
So you're gonna have a package for the 


billing line item, and then a separate 
package for each of the tact ics you're 
running. 
So Doximity is a great example of this. 
They love to say let's run a dock alert and a 
dock spot. so you'll create a package for the 
billing line item. The tact ic name would be 
billing line item. The rate type would be flat 
or whatever. The program rate type is the 
fee type. 
There field that's employees. 
The manager would be billing lineum. 
So you're sayi ng hey? 
This is where you house all the spend, and 
then you're gonna push that billing line 
item to Prisma so that you can get this 
Prisma package 10 and t hen you need to 
create a package for the DOC alert and a 
package for the doc spot and t hen in. 
The field that's called billing line item 
Prisma package 10, you link them all 
together. So you put t hat Prisma package ID 
from the billing line item into that field and 
in place manager in t he metadata so that 
we know to pull the spend from t he billing 
line item. 
And alley it to t he DOC alert and the doc 
spot each of your tactics in Prisma will need 
to have Prisma planned units. 
So that we know which tact ic is going live 
and when. 
So Carly's gonna demonstrate how we do 
this within placement manager. 
Carly, do you wanna share your screen 
again? 
Carly Fisher 38:20 
Sure. 
For this one I can just use a package that 
was already created j ust because it might 
take some time up to. 
Make 3 net new packages. 
So for using Ooximity as an example, I 
guess I can make a billing line item package 
first. 
Is that we don't have yet. 
So for the dimensions, it'll be a package. 
In name site. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 38:50 
Actually, Carly, let's just go and click into 
one of the DOC news real quick. 
Carly Fisher 38:54 
OK. 
Yeah, sure. Figure it out. 
Yeah, there's, yeah. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 38:56 
Yeah, right. 
Let's just took at it. Yeah, and then let's 
Scroll down. 
Right. 
. Carly Fisher 39:04 
So here you would need to put the billing. 
We didn't set up on Cosentyx. This way 
'cause we got guarantees and billing 
breakouts for each tactic, but. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 39:04 
Where are you there right here. 
Yes, exactly. 
Which is the right way to do it? Go the Carly 
way? Do it. 
The Carly way. That's the right way, 
The billing line item is only when the 
publisher literally refuses. 
So as Carly was saying, her team made sure 
that there was guarantees and breakouts for 
your programs. 
You should always do this. 
This is j ust a rare scenario, When they we 


had to be forced to do it like this. 
But let's just pretend for t he one we're 
showing here. If you had to set it up and 
you're like the spend's not in this package, 
it's in a different package. 
You put the Prisma package 10 here and 
that tells us for this package here where we 
need to go and find the spend. 
So you can use this for other scenarios too, 
right? 
If you ever need to connect two packages 
together, just put the Prisma package 10 
here for both of those packages. 
So put it for the billing line item and put it 
here for the actual buy so that we know. 
What how to connect the spend together 
between those two packages? 
And the Prisma ID we use it because it's it 
used to be our source of t ruth for the IOs, 
but that make sure you're putting the 
Prisma ID t here, right? 
Carly Fisher 40:16 
There may be . 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 40:26 
Starts with AP, which is different than our 
placement manager ID. Any questions? 
OK. Do you wanna go back to the side? 
Carly Fisher 40:39 
Yep . 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 40:43 
Explain. So we also are going to use t his 
field if you guys ever do have an issue 
where you did traffic a campaign and t hen 
after it launched it was like Oh no, I need to 
re traffick and this might happen if you did 
the wrong Prisma product. 
Name you did the wrong campaign or you 
did the wrong supplier. 
Code it's already gone live, and you're like, 
oh, no, Jackie, I need to retraffick. 
Happens OK. 
So what you're gonna do is you're gonna 
take your do not use package. And 
historically, what we've asked is for you 
guys to update t he names in Prisma, right 
to say do not use because of the API you 
between placement manager and Prisma, 
you're gonna be unable to. 
Update t he names in Prisma. So what? 
We ask you to do is in your do not use 
package. 
Go ahead and update it to include in the 
description. 
Onu and t hen we want you to pretend like 
it's a billing line item. 
So you'll create your new package wit h your 
new placements, and then you'll connect 
those two together with the Prisma ID. 
See how it looks like AP there your Prisma 
10 always starts at the P. 
That ID you can link them together between 
the do not use package and the new 
package. All you're saying to us is these two 
are connected together. 
You need to find the spend from these and 
add them to spend together. 
So that we can do that on the back end. 
Next slide. 
Rollovers are very similar, right? 
So a rollover is anytime you bought 
something. Let's say we're about we're 
about to h,t 2026. 
So let's say you have a buy and it is going to 
continue Into 2026. Unfortunat ely, because 
of billing, you're gonna have to retraffick 
the whole buy. 
So when you retraffick the buy and you're 
setting this up for 2026. 
You're going to put in the rollover section a 
ves no. 


So that is a rollover. 
You're gonna give us the Prisma package 10 
for the previous year's buys. 
You're gonna give us the 2025 Prisma 
package ID. 
This package ID says hey for t his program 
that's running in 2026, it also ran last year, 
so it connects them together. 
You need to tell us how many months it was 
live last year, 'cause. That's part of our 
calculation to do a cost per month for t he 
spend. And then you also have to tell us 
how many months the program's gonna be. 
Live in totality. 
This can be an estimation. 
It's OK if I'm gonna add the months it was 
live in 2025. Plus the months live in 2026. 
This would be t he total mont hs live. 
So these you have to read t raffic and you 
have to fill out all of these fields in order for 
us to correctly report out on spend for 
rollover programs. 
Any questions? 
Agai n, these are metadat a fields, so if you 
ever didn't do this and you're like, Oh no. 
I have a rollover back from 2024. 
I never updated. 
Go update it. 
You can do it at anytime, right? 
It's metadata fields, so please go and 
update any rollovers that you did not 
properly indicate from 2024 into 2025. 
Next slide. 
Production fees. 
So ideally we used to say breakout 
production fees as separate packages 
because of a variety of different reasons, 
but ideally include your production fee in 
your working media spend, so that there's 
only one package. 
Please this way we're not searching around 
for data anytime we see a production fee. If 
you do need it. 
And two two different packages. 
Create a production fee package and attack 
**** package. 
Agai n, you·re going to use that Prisma 
package ID to connect them together. 
So in the production fee Prisma package ID, 
you're going to put the Prisma, you're going 
to put the Prisma ID for that production fee 
there. And then in the tactic that it's 
associated to, you're going to give it also 
that Prisma package ID, you're linking the 
packages to. 
So that we know that production fee 
belongs to that tactic or that working media 
buy. 
Any questions? 
OK. 
o Gabrielle Charles 45:14 
Oh, I have a question. 
o Jacqueline Derron 45:14 
Next slide. 
Yeah, yeah. Go for it. 
o Gabrielle Charles 45:17 
So when you're adding, when you have a 
production fee, that's like part of a buy, but 
like say it it has a rate like there's an 
example I have of the current program 
that's like a cpuv rate. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 45:23 
Mm hmm. 
Uh huh. 
o Gabrielle Charles 45:32 
And there's like an upfront fee in January, 
but then the program officially launches in 
March. 


I you know, I want to show that the budget 
is in January, but I don't want there to be 
units. 
'Cause then that makes it look like it 's live, 
and I know, like usually your team will. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 45:48 
Yes, that is where you. That's where you do 
need the two packages, right? 
So that's a great example of how you 
should have a package for that upfront fee 
with like the rate I'm guessing probably is 
just flat right? 
Because it's free in January, 
No planned units for it because it's a fee. 
Put it in as a production fee in the fee type. 
Create a separate package for when it goes 
live in March with the cpuv. 
Rate connect them together. 
Take the Prisma production. 
Fee from the the first one that you built put 
it on the back end there for both of EM so 
we can connect them link EM . 
• 
Gabrielle Charles 46:26 
Yeah, the t hing that made it interesting with 
this package though is that like, say, it was 
like SOK wit h like a SS cpuv rate and the 
units are calculated based off of that SOK. 
But part of that SOK has a production fee. 
So techn. 
Like it's like 37 K. 
That's actually, you know, the working 
media. But like the total number of units is 
based on that SOK and so. 
I ended up having to just like. 
In order to have the correct units, I made 
the buy flat and 1 noted that it was a CPUV 
in the 10, but that was a tricky one and I 
could like I could like go off on t he side wit h 
this about you. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 47:08 
We yeah, I think you did it t here. 
You did it the right way. I would just say 
though, once we start automating for 
planned units and collecting that data from 
the publishers, we're gonna have to figure 
out what we do for stuff like that right? 
o Gabrielle Charles 47:24 
Yeah. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 47:25 
We'll figure it out. 
o Gabrielle Charles 47:27 
Cool. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 47:31 
But that's a great example of when you 
would need the two packages, right? 
There's package for the upfront fee and 
then a package for when the buy actually 
goes live. 
Link em together w it h the Prisma 
production fee ID. 
OK. 
So a lot of the information we j ust went 
through is just like, how do you set it up 
right? 
How do I get like my little base going and 
then we ask for a lot of other data and 
that's so we can break out the buy in the 
reporting. So any of the other fields that 
we're asking you guys to enter are so that 
we can break. 
Out the data in very specific ways. 
So again to the next slide we ask for you 
guys to put in. 
A couple of places. What seems like 
duplicative data. 
That right? 


You're why are you asking me for 
Medscape? Being entered three ti mes into 
the system? 
And that's because we use t hose fields for 
different t hings. 
So the in name site is the Prisma site name 
or Prisma supplier name. 
It's the must match our Prisma supplier list 
which is like that 10 list. 
It's t he 10 name that everything gets built 
towards for t hat publisher. 
The supplier is a site that was actually run 
and is going to match our metric dictionary. 
So an example here at the bottom is 
Haymarket, right ? 
Sometimes we're billing Haymarket and 
they're t he supplier, right? 
We're running on Haymarket inventory, so 
it's going to be Haymarket, Haymarket but 
Haymarket also owns PRI, so the in name 
site would be Haymarket. The supplier 
would be PRI Multimedia medical. Same 
idea. 
Somet imes we're running across all of 
mult imedia medical inventory. 
So the supplier would just be mult imedia. 
Somet imes we're running specifically on 
cancer news network for mult imedia. 
So mult imedia in name sit e while the 
supplier would be cancer news network. 
Same thing happens with Hap Shin Chan 
that one. 
That one. 
We're billi ng and then the supplier is urban 
health hemp communications. 
Great example here. In name site, hemp 
communications supplier Consultant 360. 
Have communications. 
The suppliers first managed care. 
We do this similar setup for programmatic 
too, so if you're ever running a PG deal or 
PMP deal. your name site is going to be PM 
precision. 
Your supplier though, is going to be where 
you're running. 
Maybe we're doing a PMP deal with Health 
union. The supplier would be health union. 
So this is where it tells us what site we're 
actually running on. 
We need to make sure that we're breaking 
out. 
Pmx lift apex and active in a very special 
way. 
So you're going to have your in name sit e 
being pmx. lift active or all of our different 
types of apacs. 
We have apex deals, apex audio, apex 
Outcomes, apex. You Tube. Make sure that 
you are selecting the correct in name site 
for these breaks so that you bill it correctly. 
Kylee was telling me some of t he teams had 
to retraffick stuff because they. 
Labeled the wrong apex. 
So j ust double check on that one. 
Make sure you are always selecting the 
proper one to bill the supplier is gonna be 
where we ran, right? 
So if we did an apex Amazon deal, we need 
to make sure that. 
We are putti ng down exact ly where we're 
running and then we do use the DSP field. 
I know it's not exactly a DSP, but the DSP 
field helps us keep a very clean list of active 
pmx lift and apex partners. 
That we run with. So you'll also need to 
make sure that the DSP field is filled out 
part icularly with whatever by a type you're 
running wit h one of these three partners. 
These are our internal partners. Again, if you 
don't see your site, you can request it using 
that smartsheet link. 
This is. 
Going one of our most important fields that 
WP h;:ivp in n l::,icpmpnt m::,in::,inpr ic; thP t ::,ict ic 


name. 
So you can review the Smartsheet media 
plan to see exactly which tactic we're 
running. 
Talk to your partner. Right. If you don't 
know what tactic you're running and you 
don't see it on t he list talk to your partner. 
Make sure you understand what tactic you 
are running. The publishers all have very, 
very complete list of all of the tactics. 
For any of our HCP ones, these are the exact 
same tactic names that we have in our 
metric dictionary. 
So every single time they have a new tactic, 
they're sending us a list of their tactic 
names. and that this is that list t hat they've 
sent us for HCP, for DTC. It's going to be a 
little less. 
Exact it's going to be a little bit more 
generic and that's because for DTC, we're 
really using it for benchmarking purposes. 
But review in your smartsheet what that 
tactic name is and make sure you're 
selecting the correct tactic. 
Field this is in the metadata, so if you do 
ever make a mistake here, you can always 
go and edit it and that is one of the follow-
ups from the bootcamp. If you go to the 
next slide. 
Just keeping in mind here, make sure you 
are requesting a tact ic. If you go there and 
you do not when you go to place a 
manager and you go to t hat drop down, 
you don't see your tactic. 
You need to request one for HCP. Again. 
These are the tactic names of the same 
tactic or product names that the partner 
send us, and the NPI data. 
We track all t hese tactics, they all have a 
unique ID in them and unique name. 
And they are exactly the same names that 
they send us the data with. 
So review your metric dict ionaries for HCP. 
W hen you were looking. 
For your tactic names again, if you don't see 
it, submit it to that smartsheet for OTC. 
These are going to be more generic tactic 
names. 
They're used just for benchmarking 
purposes, right? 
So if we're doing Google You Tube affinity, 
that's going to be t he same across all of 
PHM. actually, so that we can actually 
benchmark all of our OTC tactics for 2026. 
I'll be working with you guys to make sure 
that you're submitting all new items to the. 
Dictionary. 
So we're submitt ing them at an enterprise 
level so that we're not. 
Meeting and getting submissions by brand, 
right. 
So we wanna make sure that we're getting a 
complete list of tactic names by by brand so 
that it's not. 
Excuse me across all of enterprise so that 
we don't get a separate submission by 
brand. There's a complete list at the top of 
all the tactics. 
There's the metric dictionary linking and 
then if you log into placement manager, 
that's also our complete list. 
So, Carly, do you wanna show how the team 
can look in in the smartsheet to see their 
tactic names? 
Carly Fisher 54:40 
Sure, I can just open up. 
I don't know where is this links to. Oh sorry. 
Let me go back. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 54:47 
Oh, I didn't link to the the the smartsheet in 
it. Sorry, the different smartsheet. 
Sorry. this is the the link to the form 


omerem one. 
Carly Fisher 54:56 
OK. 
Yeah. So I'll just put. 
I'll pull up. 
So in the smartsheet I'll just go to. 
Hello, Hep one for example. 
But the tactic name should be in. 
The tactic column here. 
So whatever is in the tactic column, here is 
what you should be looking for in the drop 
down in placement manager. Sometimes 
the way partners provide the names will be 
a little bit different but we want to make 
sure that in the end to like media plan work. 
That we are using the name t hat reflects 
npm so that way all of our documents are 
equal and match back up. So like for 
example the provider navigator and our 
media plan workbook should match up to 
meet tactic name in placement manager 
that's labeled as the provider NAV. 
So anything in t his tactic column you want 
to make sure is directly correlating back to 
the tactic name in placement manager. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 56:20 
You want to filter for the drug monograph 
so we can show the team how to see the 
emails versus the banners. 
So this was a a nice way for when you have 
a multicomponent buy if you search for that 
tactic it will show you that example we were 
looking at for drug monograph, right. 
So you can see here you got a drug 
monograph and it comes that program is 
also coming with a t riggered e-mail. 
So if you scroll to the left or. 
We're. Yeah, we're there you go. 
You can see here how the display portion of 
the buy t hat has the spend. So your Bl 
inventory type or your budget channel is 
going to be display. 
You're going to have one package because 
you only have spend for one of these 
channels one package, and t hen you're 
going to have a placement for your banner, 
and then you're going to have a placement 
for that triggered e-mail or a custom e-mail 
there. 
So you're going to have two separate 
placements with one package. 
Search. 
And make sure it always matches to that 
tactic name. 
So we need you to go back: into your guys 
2025 campaigns and make sure that your 
tactic names match here and make sure that 
you have put it in the correct Bl inventory 
type and correct Bl format type for your 
buys. 
Let's go back to the presentation. 
OK. 
Keep going. 
Yeah, I think: we're on slide 22. 
So we just went through that example. Yep. 
Cool. 
So then make sure guys for peer-to-peer or 
P2P buys. Also our NGE or NBA whatever 
they wanna call it match. 
W hatever they want to call him, we break 
these out in a field in placement manager 
called Bl targeting type. If you ever need a 
special break. So if you if the client's asking 
for some sort of special reporting or a 
different way that they're breaking out the. 
Buy this is where we use Bl targeting type, 
but most importantly this is where we break 
out P2P or peer-to-peer campaigns. And 
your Nguyen your NBA campaigns. This 
field is in the string we need it in the string. 
In the names, so make sure you get this 
right when you first launch a program, 
because if you get it wrong, you'll have to 


go rename it and you'll have to rename it in 
Placement manager. Prisma campaign 
manager lnnovid Flash talking double verify 
with the partners and the. 
Dsp's so again, make sure you get this field 
right and you're indicating match and nge 
NBA peer-to-peer. 
Those are the most important things that 
we're indicating in t his field. 
Next slide. 
So again, the Bl i nventory type is the budget 
channel. 
We just went in t hat example for the drug 
monograph, right ? 
So make sure that in the Bl inventory type 
you're selecting. 
Your budget. 
So wherever that budget was in your 
smartsheet that's what you select in that 
field. And then the Bl format type is at the 
placement level. 
That's gonna be your asset channel or it's 
gonna be whatever actually ran. 
So you can have an e-mail wit hin your 
display budget. 
You can have an e-mail within your audio 
budget even it's all based off of what your 
budget is versus what the actual asset or 
channel is. 
Make sure also in that Bl format type field at 
the placement level you're indicating 
podcast versus streaming audio. So anytime 
you are running on a podcast specifically 
the Bl format type must be podcast. 
Otherwise for your audio buys it is 
streaming audio. 
This is so we can break this out for our 
ipmm results. 
Data partner definit ions. Now your data 
team strategy team has been all over this, 
right? 
This is very important when it comes to all 
the different state regulations that you get 
this right. 
So you need to understand the differences 
between first second and third party data. 
First party data is when you get it directly 
from Novartis, right? 
It's their own digital properties. 
Right now we have a relationshi p wit h live 
ramp and pulse point. To get this 
information. 
So it's going to be in first party is anytime 
that you're doing CRM or you're doing any 
of. 
Anything from site retargetlng from live 
ramp perspective, that is, first party data 
that we're utilizing. 
2nd party data and you select second party 
is when you're using the partner's own data. 
So if you let's let's say that we are, you 
know, running with Pandora and Pandora is 
only looking at women. 
That are 55 plus. 
They're using their own registrat ion data in 
order to target women 55 plus. So MMD or 
Healthline can do this. 
Our HCP platforms do this all the time. 
Sometimes we're working with their own 
target list. right? 
So the publisher might give us a target list. 
We might merge our target list our first 
party target list with their target list. 
That's when you select first and 2nd party 
data here. 
Now if it is a third party data provider, we 
need you to select what provider t hat is. 
Maybe we're running with cross or swoop 
or you know any of our claims based data 
as well. Anytime we're overlaying third party 
data, you need to select which third party 
data we are running with. 
Any questions here? 
This is very important when it comes to our 


data privacy, so make sure you're thinking 
about this from a Novartis perspective, not 
the media or a data provider. 
Danielle love 1:02:32 
Yeah, exactly, Jackie. 
Yeah, just to build on that a lot of t imes 
when you're talking to the publishers, right 
they're going to call it first party data 
because to them it is their first party. 
Yeah, but when we need to run through all 
of the compliance questions t hat my team 
bugged you all about recent ly, we have to 
think about it. 
Is it Novartis first party data? 
If it's the partner's first party data, then as 
Jackie said it from our perspective. 
Its second party data, so it's fine that t hey 
call it first party data, but we have to do that 
translation. 
To make it through t he lens of Novartis. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 
1:03:20 
I was on mute. 
Oh, thank you, Danielle. 
So here's some scenarios t hat Danielle put 
together. 
Scenario one. 
You're running wit h pulsepoint or live ramp, 
and you're using their data our own data to 
target and buy our data Novartis's dat a. 
So we're using their data to target so that is 
the option #1 you'll select first party data. 
Opt ion #2 Health union is using t heir own 
data. 
To get to target people along the health 
union network, that second party data 
select second party data scenario #3 at the 
end they're using Novartis as target list and 
their own target list. 
To target individuals, select first and 2nd 
party data. 
Scenario 4. 
You're running wit h crossix and you're 
running wit h swoop. 
Select crossix or you're running swoop, 
right? You need to put down if it's a third 
party provider. 
You need to put down which third party 
provider it is number 5 and there's act ually 
an updat ed slide here. 
But Epsilon, sometimes we and it might not 
just be with epsilon, but sometimes w e 
might merge both first party and 3rd party 
data. If this ever happens, you need to 
request it from us so that we can indicate it 
in place of manager. Super important for 
state Reg. 
That we call out. 
Anytime. 
It's first and third party data. 
So if that ever happens, we couldn't even 
think of an example because we're no 
longer really doing this with Epic salon. 
But you need to come and reach out to us 
so that we can properly identify that agai n 
for regulations. 
And then scenario 6 is another one iluma 
anytime you're running with that it's type of 
data provider. Anytime they are, you know 
using any activity data browsing activity to 
target your audience. Agai n, that's a thirst 
third party. 
3D Artner and you need to select down 
which third arty publisher you are running 
with. 
Any questions about your data partner? 
Data provider drop down. 
OK. 
Next slide. 
Inventory distribution type you'll see. 
Here we put down a couple of different 
options here for programmatic. 1t makes 
sense. 1t's P. 


GPMPP open exchange SSP deals if we're 
doing an SSP. 
But whenever you're doing something wit h 
a direct partner, you really need to start 
indicating if it's run the site or not. Pub 
direct oo means we are running on own and 
operated property in a very specific content. 
You know you're doing a condition center. 
Maybe you're completely taking over, you 
know, a competitor's page. 
You're running on specific content. 
Pub Direct run of site is usually given to us 
for free. 
It's generally you're running across lots of 
different parts of t he publisher's website, 
You're not running on specific. 
Specific Content pub direct programmatic. 
l et's say you're running wit h health union 
and they're running using a DSP. They 
themselves are using adsp. 
Health grades does it too. 
You want to select pub direct programmatic 
because they're actually using a DSP. 
We're not managing it. 
They are. 
It's also known as managed service, 
Network is whenever you're running on a 
lot of different websites and you have a 
direct partnership with t hose websites and 
you're not using a DSP. 
So those are your four options for inventory 
distribution type for direct buys. 
Make sure in particular you are indicating. 
Run of site so that we can break those out 
from other buys. It's gonna be very 
important for our benchmarking purposes. 
Awesome. So let's dive into when you can 
actually tag Abhay. 
Make sure you're tagging everything guys. 
Double verify verificat ion. This tells us what 
is the benchmark for our viewability 
standards. 
Keep in mind, one by ones can be tagged 
for viewability. 
The only exception is emails. 
Make sure you're talking to your partners 
about their capabilit ies. 
You should understand exactly what they 
can tag. 
What they can't tag, so for our video. 
And display non programmat ic buys are a 
display programmatic buys. 
Is our t hreshold. 
Our viewability standards is 70%. 
For video programmatic, our threshold is 
50%. If you have a high share of voice or 
custom buy and you know we have ads at 
the bottom of the page, it's going to bring 
down our viewability score. 
But they can accept tags you select. 
Double verify MRC definit ion 0% threshold. 
That's just saying, hey. w e can. 
We can tag, but you shouldn't give us any 
sort of benchmark here. 
We we expect to have a very low viewability 
score and then anytime something can't be 
tagged with double verify, some of our FEP 
buys, some of our HCP partners, you select 
no verification if they are unable to tag with 
DV. 
Check out your 10 because that's where our 
viewability standards are set. 
Play. 
0 audio and video buys are very difficult to 
set up, 
We completely understand this. 
We do have an RFP tracker, 
It's a tech rider. We'll be sending it out for 
this next upcoming RFP round as well. 
So you can go through that techrider and 
see what kind of tags your publisher can 
accept for audio and video. 


Please t ry to walk through this prioritizat ion 
right. 
So first and foremost. it's best if that buy is 
being served in INNOVID and has adcm 1 
by 1 tag. 
So again, if you have something in innovid, 
you also have to do a DCM 1 by 1 tag DCM 
1 by 1 tags is where w e get that OMA level 
data. 
Can't get it from inovid. 
So first you got to do inovid and a DCM 1 
by 1 tag. 
That's going to be how we serve a lot of our 
addressable TV's. 
R OEM buys CTVOTT any of our audio or 
just your standard online video. Your ad 
serving method in placement manager is 
going to be served in DCM and INNOVID in 
your creative length. 
Your for the creative length. 
So how long the video or how long t he 
audio ad is you're going to put t hat in the 
size or the dimension and then you're going 
to also put the creative length and the size 
and dimension. 
So you're putting in the description. 
And you're goi ng to put it in the actual. 
Size, di mension field and placement 
manager in Prisma. 
Make sure you're setti ng up the primary ad 
server to be innovid and the Prisma ad size 
field is zero by zero. That's what gets things 
confusing, right? 
So in Prisma that ad size field is zero by 
zero. If you can't serve it in DCM, serve t he 
video in. Sorry if you can't serve it in 
innovid, serve the audio or video ad within 
DCM. You'll need special approval by Ricky. 
And the media tech team, your ad serving 
methods can be served in DCM. Your 
creative length is going to be the size or 
dimensions you're going to set it up. 
Basically the exact same as you would for 
innovid, besides the primary server's going 
to be DCM. 
Agai n, you need special approval by Ricky 
and the rest of the and Julie, of course, the 
reserve beautiful media tech team. If you 
can't do DCM serve go innovid 1 by 1 and 
DCM 1 by 1. 
And this is so we can get. 
Tagging what is quartile tagging? 
That's so that we're able to tell you. 
Did you complete 25, fifty, 75% or 100% of 
your audio and your video by? So keep in 
mind t his is audio and video, so if we do a 1 
by 1 tag you're gonna put the creative 
length in the descript ion of the placement 
the. 
Placement size will be 1 by 1. 
Your primary ad server will be in a video and 
the Prisma ad side will be one by one. You 
can't do t hat. 
Go down to the DCM 1 by 1. 
You won't be. 
We won't be able to do quart ile tagging, 
but at least we'll get t hat OMA level data. 
So that's gonna be super important site. 
Servel by 1. 
You're gonna put the link in the descript ion 
and then the placement size will be 1 by 1. 
If you can't tag again, we still need a 
placement. OK. so that's only gonna be for 
those super custom buys that we're doing. 
Mvpd's. Any of our addressable TV that 
can't be tagged. 
You know, we did those podcasts with I 
heart. 
Don't do t his. 
This is a very rare thing. 
OK. 
It's taking our team a lot of time to get a lot 
of that data in. 
So this is very very last option here, but 


you'll still need a placement. The ad serving 
method again is site serve. 
No tags. 
Put the length of the creative in the 
descript ion, the placement size or 
dimension will be zero by zero and then in 
Prisma you're not going to have an ad 
server and the ad side doesn't really matter 
either because it's not tagged, but the data 
in place of manager. 
Is still. 
Very excited. 
It's the. It's still very important place a 
manager so we know to go and get data for 
it. 
So, Carly, do you wanna maybe show, 
especially in Prisma where the team can 
indicate the primary ad server and the 
Prisma ad side field? 
Carly Fisher 1:13:14 
Yes, Mia, j ust pull up, Prism a. 
And I can just pull up a campaign, for 
example purposes. 
l et me go to. 
OK. so for making sure that the zero by zero 
and one by one is reflected i n Prisma itself, 
you need to make sure that you're going 
here to this drop down and selecting the 
traffic layout. And then from here where it 
says tag size is where you either. 
Want it to reflect as zero by zero or one by 
one, so the primary ad server will be a drop 
down here and t hen you would select in a 
bit or DCM. 
Based on the partner and what they could 
take in the slide, we j ust went through with 
Jackie and then. 
For the tag size, it 'll actually be determined 
by whatever you select in the placement 
type field. 
So for instream video that will give you if 
you select that it'll give you a zero by zero. 
Something to note about t his section in 
Prisma, particularly, and you'll see it as the 
error I'm getting. 
Right now is once you sign out t he tag size 
in the traffic layout and push from Prisma to 
your ad server, you cannot go back and re 
or I guess switch over so you see how it's 
giving me an error here. 
This was already pushed as a 1 by 1, so 
when I try to change it to be an in stream 
video it's saying that this can't be changed 
because an ad server update was set. 
So something to definitely double check for 
before pushing. 
From it Prisma to your ad server for 
trafficking is to make sure t hat this column 
here in this layout accurately reflects the tag 
size you need. 
Otherwise you will need to duplicate the 
placement and then re push to Prisma. 
I mean and then re push to the ad server 
from there. So in order to just prevent doing 
double work I would j ust make sure you're 
checking this before you're going to the 
traffic tab and pushing it over. 
So. 
You can see. 
Hear that? 
If you d ick like in Page will give you this one 
by one tag size and then if you click. 
The in stream video that will give you it 
won't show it now because this was already 
pushed, but it'll give you a zero by zero here 
and then once you push to DCM or inavid it 
will show up in those ad servers as zero by 
zero. 
And then you can see also that these has to 
be trafficked as one by ones, which is why 
the. 
Creative name. 
As the one by one placement in it.

name what length the audio is, so that way 
we do have somewhere to track what is 
being served. 
Of course, if you were to switch the. 
Asset that was running from like a 60 to a 
30 or whatever, you would j ust need to 
make sure that your placement accurately 
reflects that as well. If you are putting the 
length in the placement name. 
But was t here anything else? Jackie, you 
wanted me to go through in Prisma . 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 1:16:53 
No, that's perfect. 
Does that make sense to everyone 'cause it 
is just a little confusing 'cause you're 
basically putting in the ad server, the ad 
serving method kinda twice, and then that's, 
you know, the size is where t hings get a 
little bit more confusing too, but makes 
sense to everyone on. 
The line. 
Awesome. 
OK. cool. 
So then the same sort of thing applies when 
we're looking at our companion banners, 
right? 
Talk to your partners about what they can 
accept . 
Sometimes they can accept just one 
placement. 
So when you're setting up your videos or 
your audio buys, right. your package is 
going to be based off of the budget 
channel. The B1 inventory type there, right? 
So make sure that you're selecting for your 
video. 
Even if you have a companion banner 
running right? 
We want to make sure that that package is 
what the budget's coming from. 
The Bl inventory type would be video and 
then you can have a placement. The 
placement or format type would be video 
and companion banner and then Bl format 
type would be, you know skippable or non 
skippable mix for your video here. 
So this is a place where this is how you set it 
up. If the partner only accept s 1 placement 
look at that tech RFP that we're going to be 
sending out to see if your part ner likes to 
do j ust one placement for t heir companion 
banners. 
Or if you go to the next slide. 
Sometimes they ask you for two 
placements, a placement for the video or 
audio, and then a placement for the 
companion banner. Again, your Bl i nventory 
type is your budget. 
Channel it is going to be focused on where 
your budget is coming from and then you'll 
have a placement for your companion 
banner, the placement or format type would 
be companion banner Bl format type would 
be video companion banner and then if you 
have a separate placement for. 
The video you would have that placement 
or format type. 
B2B video and t hen the Bl format type 
would be OOV, skippable or a non 
skippable mix. 
Try to break out skippable versus non 
skippable. 
Try to force your publishers to do that. 
That will be a new break that they want in 
ipmm soon enough, so please make sure 
you're trying to always break it out between 
skippable and non skippable if possible. 
That's how you do companion banners, OK. 
So we've talked about how you set up 
everything at an overall level. 
We've talked about how we have all these 
different breaks in our buys. We went into 
tagging and now we need to make sure you 
miv, 1mrlPro.;t~nrl thP nP.::itivP IPvPI .(.PtlJO. ~o 


generally with our ads served buys, we have 
the creative aor's go into creative manager 
and set. 
Things up, but anytime it's a one by one, it's 
on us. 
To set up the creative level. So first and 
foremost t his happens a lot with emails. 
So Carly, if you go to the next 1, so It's 
super important that you understand the 
difference between custom versus 
newsletter emails. 
A custom e-mail is when the entire e-mail 
has our content right ? 
There's no other content in that e-mail 
besides our e-mail. 
We come up wit h a subject line we come up 
with everything in there. 
Your Bl format type can be t riggered. 
E-mail it could be custom e-mail. 
It's you're gonna see a custom drop down 
list. 
First based off of what you put at that 
budget level. 
So then your Bl format type is gonna give 
you a list of different types of emails, but a 
triggered e-mail is also referred to as a 
custom e-mail. And then your placement or 
format type would be CMEL which stands 
for custom e-mail and then this. 
Difference is newsletters, right? 
Newsletters are we also refer to them as 
banner emails? 
It's just a banner within an e-mail. 
The rest of the content is the publishers, so 
or it could be. 
Even, maybe even our competitors. 
Who knows, but the rest of the e-mail is not 
just our content. 
It is j ust our banners that are in the e-mail 
so your Bl format type is gonna be 
newsletter or could be newsletter wit h 
display depends on what you selected at 
that Bl inventory type or that Channel level 
and then this is just what we're putting 
down as our. 
Subchannel and then your placement or 
format type would be bmel which would be 
your banner e-mail. 
Here are our setup rules for one by one. 
First you need to have packages for each of 
your emails, so you want to make sure that 
you have a separate package for your e-
mail t actics. If you have an e-mail 
component that runs in different mont hs 
than your other components of your buy, 
you'll need to create a. 
Separate package for t hose emails as well. 
Tie them together like a billing line it em. 
Placements 1 placement per e-mail send. 
So you cannot have multi ple placements 
per e-mail. 
The data comes back incorrectly. The NPI 
data comes back incorrectly if you have 
multiple placements. 
So if you have like 3 banners going into a 
newsletter, you still are going to have one 
placement even though you have three 
separate banners. 1 placement you break 
out the sizes at the creat ive level. 
For the fuse 10, make sure you're always 
filling out that creative 1 by 1 ID. 
Field in placement manager, that's where 
you put the content ID. 
That's where you put the MLR ID. You don't 
have that ID yet. 
Put Na but you must go back and fill that 
out. A lot of our e-mail partners, DMD in 
part icular. 
They only want to track our emails using 
that 10, so make sure that you are filling 
that out. Once you have that information. 
If you have mult iple fuse IDs in one e-mail. 
You're gonna break out. 
Th:.t fuc c In 


Those fuse IDs at the creative level. 
So again one placement. 
Multiple creatives. And then you're going to 
see a field in the creative level that's called 
one by one name, 
It's going to be able to label out exactly 
what your impression tag is looking at 
versus all of your different click tags. So 
each e-mail action should be indicated at 
the creative level in that one by one name 
so we can see exactly what's tagged. Did 
you tag? 
The open was that the call to action was 
that the PDF you need to tell us in that one 
by one name. So we know exactly what you 
tagged with. 
Here 1 by 1 next slide. 
So if you have a custom e-mail with 
multiple content IDs, again at the placement 
level. do one per e-mail, send. Each custom 
e-mail should have one placement per e-
mail send. If you do have only one content 
ID, you put that in the one by one creatrve 
ID field. 
And place a manager at the creative level. 
This is where you're telling us exactly what 
you tagged, right? 
So you're gonna have an impression tag 
that's your open for emails, right? 
So your 1 by 1 tag name will be open. 
For your imression tag, any of the clicks 
within that e-mail need to have a different 1 
by 1 tag name, so you can you can select Pi 
if it's the Pi information PDF, it's the PDF 
you're tagging CTA. If it's a call to action, 
your creative type will. 
Be tracking and then your size is just going 
to be one by one across the board 'cause 
this is a custom e-mail. 
You want to go to the next slide. 
Newsletters make sure that you're again 
only doing 1 placement per e-mail send. 
Do not create a separate packet placement 
for each creative wit hin the e-mail. The 
dimension size should only be 1 by 1. The 
actual size of the creative is at the creative 
level. 
So going to the creative side of things, the 
impression tag again 1 by 1 tag name is 
going to be open. Creative type is going to 
be tracking, tracking. Your creative size is 
going to be 1 by 1 because. 
It's the open of your e-mail within the e-
mail. Each click tag is gonna be each of your 
separate banners within t hat newsletter. 
So let's say we had a banner that was 
Melanoma, one that was long one that was 
RCC. You would have in there. The one by 
one tag name is image because it is just an 
image. 
It's just a banner that we are putting within 
that e-mail. 
The creative type is static 
It's a static banner within that e-mail and 
then create a size as the actual creat ive size. 
Of that banner, making sure that you're 
putting down the creative agency too. 
So we know exactly who is building out that 
creative for us that we're putting within the 
newsletter. 
So Carly, do you want to open the one by 
one builder and show them where they can 
find this information? 
Carly Fisher 1:25:44 
Yep, it's just opening right now. 
Yeah. 
Also oh sorry, I'm just gonna flag too that 
there is. 
o Jacqueline Derron 1:25:53 
Is it perfect? Mm hmm. 
Carly Fisher 1:25:59 


.,..,. A file t hat gets updated by the Media tech 
team and other teams as well. So anytime 
you need to build out a one by one, I would 
recommend going into this link and 
downloading the document from here as if 
there are updates that were made to the 
one. 
By one t racker, it won't necessarily be 
reflected in the version that you 
downloaded. 
From whenever we downloaded your last 
version. 
That I can. 
Open it up. 
So you would just fill it out the way that you 
typically. 
Would for any. 
Creative. So you would do the brands, the 
campaign type and t hen for the creative 
message this is. 
The like free form space. 
So there's no drop down that you need to 
include here, but you should be using the 
creative message that is being used for the 
e-mail. So if this is. 
like an impression t racker for example, you 
would just put impression tracker if it was 
an image you could put. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 1:27:10 
Wait sorry, sorry. that's not right. 
Carly Fisher 1:27:10 
Emmett sorry. 
o 
Jacqueline D~on 1:27:12 
So the creative message. 
Carly Fisher 1:27:12 
Oh, sorry. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 1:27:14 
The creative message, if it is the impression 
tracker, try to make it the subject line of the 
e-mail if possible. If you know it for the the 
creative message for the impression t racker. 
Carly Fisher 1:27:28 
OK. 
Yeah. So and for supplier, you would 
choose. 
The supplier. 
The e-mail is I'll just use Medscape for 
example and then for the unique creative ID 
fuse code you would just drop in t he fuse 
code that was included in t he link matrix. 
Again. If you have multiple fuse codes in an 
e-mail, you would need to make a separ. 
Creative for each of those fuse codes. 
So just for example, I'm just gonna do that 
and then the expiration date. 
This should come in the brief form from 
cast. so you should include. 
Any of or. I guess there should be one 
expiration date for t he e-mail and make 
sure you're including that here as well so I 
can just put it up here and then content 
topic is a drop down and you will need to 
get this information from the A. 
So you cannot t raffic a one by one unless 
the AOR confirms or I shouldn't say what 
you can traffic. 
One by one, creat ive that we are generating 
unless we have the AOR confirm whatever 
this content topic needs to be, 
So you would select whichever topic the 
AOR assigns and then for the one by one 
tag name ID. 
This is where you would select for the 
impression tracker if it was at open, or if it 
was. 
The nor PDF or j ust a banner? 
You would select whichever 1. 
CTA would be for like the click taos so I can 


select one as an example and then, 
The creative agency will be whatever agency 
you're working with. 
And then. 
I did notice in here t hat in this version the 
creative type, the only option that we have 
is tracking. 
I know Jackie just went over that. 
That there are multiple ones that we can 
use, so this might need to be edited in the 
actual. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 
Yes. 
1'29,23 
Julia, let's make a note of that. 
We should update t hat to have static, right? 
So tracking is going to be anytime. 
It's just. 
Like a impression or click. 
6 Julia Johnson 1:2:9:36 
So . 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 1:2:9:36 
But if it's like an actual static banner, that's 
when we want to put down stat ic there. 
lit;. Julia Johnson 1:2:9:38 
"' Good. 
Yeah, let's. 
Yeah, let's let's connect on that after that, 
because I know it's gone back and forth. 
Actually it used to, yeah. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 
1:2:9:51 
Or if between the two. 
Carly Fisher 1:2:9:51 
Please can you? 
f;) Julia Johnson 1:2:9:53 
And we were, well, we can. 
Yeah, we can take that offline, but yeah, 
we'll update it to make sure it's, yeah . 
• 
Jacqueline Derron 
1:2:9:56 
Let's take that offline. 
Carly Fisher 1:2:9:57 
Let's take a look at. Yeah, we'll figure it out. 
8 Jacqueline Derron 1:2:9:57 
Yeah, we'll figure out which one 1t should 
be. 
Carly Fisher 1 :2:9:59 
Which one it should be? 
6 Julia Johnson 1:30:01 
Cool. Thank you. 
Carly Fisher 1:30:03 
And then for creative size, if it is j ust a 
custom e-mail, you could put one by one. If 
it is for like a banner that 's being served in 
an e-mail, you could put the banner size 
that's being served in the e-mail. 
And then once you have all of t hese drop

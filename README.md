## 📚 Data Enablement Chatbot

Your company brain, bottled.  
This chatbot surfaces answers from trainings, bootcamps, decks, transcripts, and team discussions — so knowledge actually sticks instead of vanishing into Slack threads or buried folders.  

### Why It Matters
- ⚡ **Onboarding** → New hires ramp faster with real answers, not scavenger hunts  
- 🔄 **Consistency** → Everyone hears the same thing, every time  
- 🕵️ **Audit-Ready** → Cites exactly where the info came from  
- 💬 **Always On** → Ask about anything ever said in your enablement materials  

Instead of “where’s that slide?” → just ask the bot.  

## 📌 What It Does

- Search training decks, transcripts, and guides
- Answer questions clearly, with sources cited
- Say “Not in the docs” when something isn’t covered (no hallucination bonus content)

> Think of it as the intern that knows where everything is, minus the intern.

Basically: less chaos, more confidence.
